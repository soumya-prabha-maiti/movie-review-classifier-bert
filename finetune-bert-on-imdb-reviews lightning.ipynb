film all by themselvesbut to trade on the hp franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference albeit minor to the earlier movies i m sure everyone who wanted to see it was hoodwinked into thinking that they were seeing a sequel not a totally different film with a familiar name and i m sorrykym whitley is not funny and could not hold a candle to the late robin harris ketty lester or dc curry in the earlier films although meagen good and mari morrow are a substantial visual diversioni have to give this a thumbs down just naming the film down to the last minute

concern a conceited blow hard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and both ultimately show the blow hard slowly learning about teamwork and decency in this film william haines is tom brown and his main rival bob is played by frances x bushman and in a supporting role is jack pickford always remembered as the brother of mary of these three pickford comes off the best as the sympathetic loser who becomes tom s pal he actually has a few decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the big game all the standard clich s are there and the movie because it was done so many times before and since offers few surprises however it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewing in my opinion for a better silent college film try harold lloyd s the freshman it s football scenes are frankly more exciting and harold is far more likable and sympathetic than the annoying tom brown the freshman is probably the best college picture you can find from the era another reason why brown at harvard is a lesser picture is that william haines played essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again such as in westpoint and the smart set among others and if you ve seen one of these films you ve seen them all well made but certainly not original and because it is just a rehash of his other films anyone giving the film a score of 10 is strongly advised to see these other films 4 25 08 i just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on imdb from the 1920 talk about over rated there are dozens and

detective robert young investigates with the help of robert mitchum who s assigned to ryan s outfit suspicion falls on the second of the three george cooper who has vanished ryan slays the third buddy steve brodie to insure his silence before young closes in abetted by a superior script by john paxton dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring bobs ryan naturally does his prototypical angry white male and to the hilt while mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance his role however is not central young may never have been better gloria grahame gives her first fully fledged rendition of the smart mouthed vulnerable tramp and as a sad sack who s leeched into her life paul kelly haunts us in a small peripheral role that he makes memorable the politically engaged dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing but it s pretty much confined to young s reminiscence of how his irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier thus incidentally stretching chronology to the limit at least there s no attempt to render an explanation however glib of why ryan hates jews and hillbillies and curiously crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it the novel it s based on richard brooks the brick foxhole dealt with a gay bashing murder but homosexuality in 1947 was still beyond the pale news of the holocaust had however begun to emerge from the ashes of europe so hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against anti semitism the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer but while the change from homophobia to anti semitism works in general the specifics don t fit so smoothly the victim s chatting up a lonesome drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd even though or especially since there s a girlfriend in tow it raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tip off to the original engine generating ryan s murderous rage',\n","       'i really in enjoyed watching this movie like most of the people that watched it i wasn t sure that i was getting whoopi goldberg is a very funny comedian

black family moving up from a nice neighborhood in the city to an upper middle class neighborhood i would say more but it think it would spoil the movie this movie does not just deal with race

happen when the ending is finally reveled you realize that you just wasted an hour of your life waiting for a big payoff that doesn t happen and means nothing to what you have been watching the only

of the plot it begins with an ordinary joe who commutes to his office job every day who becomes inspired to take dance lessons along the way the protagonist and the assorted characters he meets in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor learn lessons about others and about themselves the story has a prologue about what dancing in japan symbolizes sociologically so it isn t exactly as simple to learn to dance in japan as it is here in the us the film is lighthearted you ll laugh out loud at some of the sight gags yet it is also dignified in a way hard to describe all of the film s characters are taken seriously as they are and none are diminished because of their imperfections i ve been thinking about taking social dance classes with some friends it just so happened a friend lent me the video on learning to dance is this synchronous or what i think so because now i m really geeked to give it a try watch this wonderful family film small children might not get it but teens certainly

at a showing of the film the manson family at the three penny in chicago as part of the chicago underground film festival here s what i have to say about it first of all the film is an obvious rip off of every kenneth anger roman polanski oliver stone and terry gilliam movie i ve ever seen second of all in a short q a session after the show mr van bebble immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual manson family members or charlie himself calling them liars and saying he wanted nothing to do with them that the film was based on his van bebble s take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on tv and in the news and i m assuming from the autobiography and the book helter skelter which were directly mimicked through the narrative so i had second dibs on questions i asked if he was trying to present the outsider mtv sex drugs and rock n roll version and not necessarily the true story this question obviously pissed off the by now sloshed director who started shouting f you shut the f up this is the truth all those other movies are bullsh well anyway i didn t even think about how ridiculous this was until the next day when i read the tagline for the film you ve heard the laws side of the storynow hear the story as it is told by the manson family excuse me if this guy has never even spoken to the family and considers them to be liars that he doesn t want to have anything to do with how in god s name can he tell the story for them this is the most ridiculous statement i have ever heard the film was obviously catered to the sex drugs and rock n roll audience that it had no trouble in attracting to the small dimly lit theatre and was even more obviously spawned by the sex drugs and rock n roll mind of a man who couldn t even watch his own film without getting up every ten minutes to go get more beer or to shout some sort of rocky horroresque call line to the actors on screen this film accomplishes little more than warping the public s image of actual events which helped shape the state of america and much of the world today into some sort of slasher comic book porno rape fantasy dreamed up by an obviously shallow individual the film was definitely very impressive to look at the soundtrack was refreshing as it contained actual samples of charlie s work with the family off of his lie album the editing was nice and choppy to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern music videos all in all this film would have made a much better addition to the catalogues at mtv than to the underground film festival or for that matter the minds of any intellectual observers i felt like i was at a midnight rocky horror viewing the way the audience was dressed and behaving probably the best part of the experience the cast was very good with the exception of charlie who resembled some sort of stoned dungeons and dragons enthusiast more than the actual role he was portraying the descriptions the film gave of him as full of energy throwing ten things at you and being very physical about it all the while did not match at all the slow lethargic and chubby representation that was actually presented all in all the film basically explains itself as sadie or maybe it was linda declares at the end you can write a bunch of bullsh books or make a bunch of bullsh moviesetc etc case in point even the disclaimer based on a true story is a dead giveaway signalling that somewhere beneath this psychedelic garbage heap lay the foundation of an actual story with content that will make and has made a difference in the world all you have to do is a little bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the the crap or actually maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read a book instead all i can say is this when the film ended i got a free beer so i m glad i went but not so glad i spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be told to shut the f up for asking the director a question peace',\n","       'thought

maryland and the only reason i agreed to gowas because it was free i expected a few chuckles but as i have never been a huge fan of tenacious d not much more then that the first ten minutes of the film are hilarious as we are given a look at jack black s humble christian origins in a midwest american town the film then takes us years into the future to the first meeting between jb and kyle gass the second half of tenacious d we see the formation of the band and the genesis of its name finally as the title suggests the second half of the film details their quest to obtain the fabled pick of destiny again the beginning of the film was laugh out loud funny and most of the movie at least kept a smile on my face that said there were times it felt a bit long it s only 100 minutes but it still felt like it should have been a bit shorter the story is every bit as absurd as it sounds and this is not a film you see if you want a real plot which is fine except it means that many of the jokes are very hit or missand when they miss they miss bad same thing with the songs it is a musical but many of the songs lost their appeal after the first minute or sothen kept going anyway i will say that the r rating really saved this movie from bombing the d s humor simply couldn t work without cussing sex and drug references but unless you re a real fan of the band or at the very least know you appreciate their style of comedy i would recommend you save yourself some money and rent pick will make you giggle a bitbut is it worth 9 bucks i don t think so i was tempted to rate it a 6 but since

in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie i m sure the topless girls doesn t hurt there either the extra features on the dvd were even more confusing than the rest of the movie i thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing who are these people and what are they doing basically this is a go camping to make out then fight a monster movie but there are a bunch of things like the other dimension and book seller than make it confusing i didn t like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal i don

warner brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit show with producing a feature length movie originally slated for direct to video but bumped up to theatrical status it would become known as batman mask of the phantasm ten years after phantasm we have had an additional three feature films released from the boys at the wb sub zero return of the joker and now mystery of the batwoman joins the family the plot is basic and in many ways similar to mask of the phantasm a new female vigilante modeling herself after batman has begun targeting operations run by gotham mob boss rupert thorne and oswald cobblepot aka the penguin now batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the batwoman before she crosses the line the animation is the sleeker futuristic style that was utilized for batman the animated series fifth and sixth seasons aka the new batman adventures it s quite nicely done and just as sleek as return of the joker s animation there is also some use of cgi but it s minor compared to the overabundance of it in sub zero the music was alright different and exotic and similar to the justice league score although the points in the score when the old animated batman theme comes up will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older fans rodent shaped hearts kevin conroy as always does a wonderful job as bruce wayne and batman it s also great to have the old batman the animated series alumni back that includes bob hastings commissioner gordon robert costanzo detective bullock tara strong barbara gordon batgirl her cameo hints at the romantic relationship between her and bruce that was mentioned in batman beyond and efrem zimbalist jralfred villains were also great especially given that rupert thorne the old mob boss from the original series appears for the first time since the fourth season overall while not quite reaching the standard set by mask of the phantasm ten years ago motb carries on the torch quite nicely for the animated batman films

philosophy the two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about quantum physics in this mess is just plain wrong examples quantum theory supports the ideas in eastern religions that reality is an illusion how well in the world of the subatomic you can never definitely predict a particles location at a specific time you can only give the odds of it being precisely at one spot at one time also the act of observation seems to affect the event solid particles can pass through barriers all of this so far is accurate but then they assert that that means that if you believed sincerely enough that you could walk through a wall you could indeed do it this is complete poppycock instead the theory asserts that at our level it is possible for you to walk through a wall but it is merely by chance and has nothing to do with belief also you d have to keep walking into the wall for eternity to ever have even the remotest chance of passing through the wall the odds are so astronomically against it this is but one example of how they misrepresent the science but much more annoying is the narrative involving an unhappy photographer played by marlee maitlan about halfway through the picture it becomes so confused as to be incomprehensible something to do with negative thoughts leading to addiction and self hate there may be some truth to that but quantum physics has nothing to do with it plus string theory is the hot new thing in physics nowadays instead of wasting your time with this dreck i suggest you rent the elegant universe an amazing series done for nova

physically non descript middle aged man originally from salerno in southern italy when we re introduced to him at the start of the film he s been living a non life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italian speaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamo s cash tell him that 10000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes at the news he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account meanwhile he tells us the spectators that when you bluff you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous he says you can t bluff for a while and then halfway through tell the truth having eventually done this bluffed only halfway through and told the truth and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love is exactly the reason behind the beginning of titta di girolamo s troubles this initially unsympathetic character a scowling taciturn curt man on the verge of 50 a man who won t even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about at one point in his non life titta decides to feel concern about appearing ridiculous the first half of the film may be described as slow by some it does indeed reveal di girolamo s days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined deliberate pace revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details however scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes the existence of titta di girolamo the man with no imagination identity or life the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music one theme by the scottish band boards of canada especially stood out never was the contrast between the way hollywood and italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as le conseguenze dell amore or l imbalsamatore another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist s insomnia not unlike the machinist and in a far more explicit way the al pacino film insomnia le conseguenze dell amore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that s been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious it s almost impossible to pin point its cause if indeed there is one the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia played by olivia magnani grand daughter of the legendary anna and the memory of titta s best friend a man whom he hasn t seen in 20 years unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that titta eventually though tentatively at first accepts to look through again though it s never explicitly spelt out the spectator knows that to a man like titta accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences a film without a single scene of sex or violence a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator s expectations le conseguenze dell amore is a fine representative of that small quiet discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of cinecitt during the second half of the 70s the world is waiting for italy to produce more il postino like fare more la vita bella style films neglecting to explore fine creations like le conseguenze dell amore l imbalsamatore and others your loss world',\n","       'maybe it was the title or the trailer certainly not the interview on the dvd which is with the director as he keeps saying hi kids into the camera like a buffoon but i had expectations for entrails of a virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal bloody killings by a weird japanese penetrator turns out it s way too sleazy for its own good or bad or whatever there s a problem and one can see this also in the italian sexploitation flick porno holocaust similar to this in many respects in not having balance to the sex and violence too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies and with the killing scenes there has to be at least a little tack and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity in creating the creature killer whatever entrails of a virgin has neither it s safe to say it s a pretty soulless movie even if isn t one of the very worst ever made it s there just for horn dog japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their other heads in this case we re given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls nothing too salacious and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by a murderer as he s credited first off the director kazuo gaira komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on we get spliced in or phoned in take your pick clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere it looks like it s from another movie then once settled into the house there s a wrestling scene that s poorly choreographed and shot yeah we really need to see him all there and then on to the rape and killings first the rape by the photographers who promise the girls some jobs for their time then the murderer who like d amato s creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial and who for an unknown reason kills the men and or rapes the women one by one now the latter of those taken by themselves should be considered the highlights of the movie this is like saying however that the cro tons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad an eye gouging scene a spike thrown like an olympic event that scene actually is kind of cool and finally the entrailing of the overly sex crazed girl whose inconsequential name i can t remember even this becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title on top of this the sex scenes which become tedious through gaira and his indulgence in long takes without cutaways where everything by the japanese censors is blurred anyway are dubbed over by the actors you d think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough hence the need to let them speak for themselves but the overall feeling from entrails of a virgin is that of a lumpy one where it s just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror watch as the last girl left alive the virgin of the picture tries to stop the murderer from getting to her which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him you just want it to be done with for the i hate women mantra to ease up or be rid altogether',\n","       'one of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 oz episode you ll be hooked they are right as this is exactly what happened with me the first thing that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence which set in right from the word go trust me this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs sex or violence its is hardcore in the classic use of the word it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum

is home to manyaryans muslims gangstas latinos christians italians irish and moreso scuffles death stares dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn t dare forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences forget charm forget romanceoz doesn t mess around the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal i couldn t say i was ready for it but as i watched more i developed a taste for oz and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence not just violence but injustice crooked guards who ll be sold out for a nickel inmates who ll kill on order and get away with it well mannered middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of

happy resolution when the monster died in the end i didn t care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots i love them now for the unintentional humor but about a year or so later i saw psycho when it came out and i loved that the star janet leigh was bumped off early in the film i sat up and took notice at that point since screenwriters are making up the story make it

prostitute from gubra and the chick at the snooker pad turns out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future and i absolutely love the voice overs its crude yet awakeningly fresh like when they took a shot of the rumah tumpangan gamin signboard then there was suddenly mukhsin s voice saying bismillahhirrahmannirrahim the scene when he climbed the tree it captured malaysian s

assassin fruition of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deeper into the world she rampaged through so mercilessly during the first saga that s as poetical as i ll get when talking about azumi 2 death or love because when i cringed over the heavy sentimentality of house of flying daggers and complained about the credibility of aya ueto portraying a blood driven assassin after watching azumi 2 i started to appreciate the previously mentioned shortcomings more than ever before not only does the determination of each assassin feels sluggish and uninspiring but also many important elements are omitted from the entire experience in azumi 1 we saw the assassins use various stealth tactics which is their number one priority as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape but i won t hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacles are planted in azumi s way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and displaying any signs of charisma by the way chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of go go minus the cool weapon and sense of menace this brings me to the final blow which is the action simply disguised in the title as the death side of the epic in the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier weapons to no one s surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily in azumi 1 the young assassins were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between azumi and bijomaru in comparison to the fights in azumi 2 was at least climaxed and worthwhile some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter i am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further enriched the romance side of azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides a much needed resolution as a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation i won t lie and i ll admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first azumi film but i ll step right up and say that after watching azumi 2 the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece for what it s worth azumi 2 death or love could have gone straight to video with its invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassins doing their best to restore the peace with an unwavering courage to die

the campers as well as one another then there is much made of their wealthy rivals from across the lake named camp mohawk which culminates in a two day olympiad competition above it all is bill murray clowning around and making a pretty memorable film debut the film is sprinkled with medium sized laughs chuckles and more than a few guffaws along the way the biggest laughs come from the pranks played on the nerdy camp director three of them involve the counselors moving his bed outside in various locations while he s sleeping morty or micky as everyone calls him wakes up along the side of a road strung up in some trees several feet above the ground and finally floating on a raft in the middle of the lake there are also some funny moments involving the counselors hitting on one another but this is a pg rated film with little in the way of raunchiness the film takes a serious note involving a shy camper named rudy who is played by chris makepeace of course it s up to murray to teach the kid how to open up and give him the confidence he needs to run a marathon during the olympiad the sentimentality of rudy s situation seems tacked on to a great degree notice how when murray first sees the kid sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus he tells him you must be the short depressed kid we ordered makes you wonder if that line was really in the script or murray was just ad libbing while the cameras were rolling in other words murray might as well have said to makepeace you must be that actor we hired to play the stereotypical lonely kid you see in most summer camp films who doesn t fit in but before it s all over murray s performance makes this plot device more than bearable he really seems to have some good chemistry with makepeace the film culminates with the games between the two rival camps very little of the events we are shown are even slightly believable but it just doesn t matter this is a pretty good film on many levels don t let the absurd 56

'i firmly believe that the best oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons 1 host steve martin was at his most wittiest i saw the teamsters help michael moore into the trunk of his limo and i ll better not mention the gay mafia in case i wake up with a poodle s head in my bed 2 surprise winners no one had adrien brody down for best actor genuine applause or roman polanski for best director genuine jeers and boos but they won last year s award ceremony wasn t too bad but there was little in the way of surprises and i was happy to see return of the king sweep the awards even if it wasn t the best in the trilogy fellowship was much better but what let the bbc coverage down was jonathan ross getting a few of his sycophantic mates round and pretending they were hilarious when they were anything but so when i heard sky were doing the coverage for british tv i was expecting barry norman and mark kermode to be doing the links but instead we ended up with jamie theakston and sharon osbourne oh gawd if british tv are desperate for film critics obviously they are i m sure both bob the moo and theo robertson will happily fly over to la to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers chris rock wasn t too bad but he s no steve martin while the location seemed to resemble a sports hall with seats put in not much of a glitzy arena in my opinion the main problem i had with the ceremony was the format with the minor oscars handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats there s no such thing as a minor oscar and just because the award is for best animated short or best costume design they re as well deserved as best picture or best director all the winners should be allowed to march up to the podium what a bunch of arrogant snobs the academy are becoming and i quite agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful and if it wasn t for the surprises this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history as for the awards themselves best supporting actress cate blanchett no great surprise for a competitive category best supporting actor morgan freeman no real complaints since freeman is one of america s greatest living character actors best actor jamie foxx most predictable award of the night yawn best actress hilary swank major surprise since everyone thought annette benning was going to win simply down to academy politics but swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night best director clint eastwood major surprise since everyone thought scorsese was going to get the award simply because he d never won one actually i m glad about this because if he didn t deserve it for taxi driver raging bull or goodfellas he didn t deserve it for the aviator best film million dollar baby again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while i thought the hollywood friendly plot of the aviator would have made it a dead cert for best picture while mdb s controversial subject matter would have turned a lot of voters off what these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they haven t done in the past i mean a beautiful mind beating the fellowship of the ring for gawd s sake and long may the academy vote

of uppity hollywood peasants who address the camera as though it were a moving train and just for kicks a passel of homoeroticism that is not limited to castro s manic and unremitting cigar fellatio never trust a medved but even a busted clock is right twice a day this is a historically awful movie',\n","       'despite some reviews being distinctly luke warm i found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as mills and boon so what it is good to see a warm touching story of real love in these cynical times many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes you really believe that the young victoria and albert are passionately fond of each other even though for political reasons it was an arranged marriage i did feel though that sir john conroy who was desperate to control the young queen is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain as it is rumoured that he was in fact the real father of victoria as a result of an affair with her mother the duchess of kent it would have been interesting to explore this theory emily blunt is totally convincing as the young princess trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her she brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made victoria a great queen of england which prospered as never before under her long reign i believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie',\n","       'demon wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs it is definitely an awful example of a film so awful in fact that i don t even consider it a movie i describe it more as a thing a monstrous thing a thing that must be stopped at all costs my friends and i first discovered this thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friend s house it was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies we unfortunately picked this one well during the 90 minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up the thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word it s just a cheap poorly done rip off of evil dead the whole story seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting demons rip them to pieces i have a bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed i ve seen bad horror movies before manos troll 2 hobgoblins shudder i would have to say that demon wind could definitely contend with any and all of these films on terms of sheer stupidity watch it only if you enjoy laughing at stupid films fun fact this film is like a cockroach on steroids much like the ouija board every time we try to get rid of it it always seems to mysteriously reappear kind of scary huh',\n","       'even though i saw this film when i was very young i already knew the story of wild the thief taker and shepherd who famously escaped from newgate prison apart from the liberty taken right at the end the film more or less faithfully follows the true story the temptation to bend the facts which is the hallmark of so many so called historical films is resisted in this film and the film makers must be praised for that of the performances there is scarcely a poor performance and tommy steele is ideally cast also good is stanley baker as the thief taker and alan badel is good as always because the film sticks to the facts it makes it suitable to be watched by all the family',\n","       'one word can describe this movie and that is weird i recorded this movie one day because it was a japanese animation and it was old so i thought it would be

as possible about films before attending because trailers and reviews provide spoiler after spoiler all i knew upon entering the theater is that it was a documentary about a long married couple and that imdb readers gave it a 78 rotten tomatoes users ranked it at 79 and the critics averaged an amazing 82 if anything they underrated this little gem filmmaker doug block decided to record his parents for posterity and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the requisite interviews with his parents outspoken mother mina and less than forthcoming dad mike i immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker mike mina s son doug was going to take us as a matter of fact i doubt that doug himself knew where he was going with this life takes unexpected twists and turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey it is difficult to verbalize just how moved i was with this story and the unique way in which it was told absolutely riveting from beginning to end and it really is a must see even if you aren t a fan of the documentary genre this film will make you think of your own life and might even evoke memories that you thought were long forgotten 51 birch street is one of those rare filmgoing experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves you the best news of all is that hbo had a hand in the production so instead of playing to a limited art house audience eventually millions of people will have a chance to view this incredible piece of work bravo',\n","       'after sitting through this pile of dung my husband and i wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie it was that listless and formulaic but the us propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film proves disappointingly that it s the work of humans call me a conspiracy theorist but quotes like we have to steal the declaration of independence to protect it seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of iraq etc the fact that nicholas cage spews lines like i would never use the declaration of independence as a bargaining chip with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took valium before shooting each scene the reasoning behind each plot turn and new clue is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow and there s also a bonus side plot of misogyny with dr whatever her name was being chided by all involved for never shutting up she s clearly in the movie only for looks but they felt the need to slap a dr title on her character to give her some gravity at one point cage s character says don t you ever shut up and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands like she s a child truly grotesque the only benefit to this movie was that it s so astonishingly bad you do get a few laughs out of it the really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it creepy',\n","       'during the clete roberts preface i was beginning to think this was an ed wood production however what rolls out here is some pretty hard hitting stuff the story of crime and

edward g robinson who s the cattle baron here but robinson is crippled and there is some hint that his injuries may have left him impotent no matter to barbara whose needs are being met by her brother in law brian keith that doesn t sit well with either dianne foster who is robinson and stanwyck s daughter nor with lita milan who is keith s mexican girl friend the infidelity subplot almost takes over the film but glenn ford as the stalwart small rancher who is a civil war veteran come west for his health manages to hold his own here he s every inch the quiet western hero who people make the mistake of pushing once too often i almost expect those famous words from wild bill elliott to come out of ford s mouth i m a peaceable man would have been very applicable in the vioilent men the fifties was the age of the adult western themes were entering into horse operas that hadn t been explored before the following year glenn ford would do another western jubal one of his best which also

the main reason why i actually decide to see this movie and after having seen it i was really a disappointed and this comes from the guy that loves this genre of movie i m surprise at this movie all completely it is like a kid s movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and it all involve little children cursing and swearing i m not at all righteous but this has really gone too far in my account synopsis the story about two guys got send to the big brother program for their reckless behavior there they met up with one kids with boobs obsession and the other is a medieval freak just the name it self is not really connected with the story at all they are not being a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have done the story is very predictable though expected and the humor is lame and haven t we already seen the same characters play by mc lovin in so many other movies like sasquatch gang i think i laugh thrice and almost fell a sleep well the casting was alright after all he is the one that produce the screenplay and the acting is so so as expected when you re watching this type of movie and the direction what do one expect this is the same guy who brought us wet hot american summer and that movie also sucks but somehow he always managed to bring in some star to attract his horrendous movie anyway i felt not total riff off but a completely waste of time only the naked scenes seem to be the best part in the movie can t really see any point why i should recommend this to anyone pros elizabeth bank two topless scenes cons not funny dreadful

   'some comments here on imdb have likened dog bite dog to the classic cat iii films of the 90s but although it is undoubtedly brutal violent and very downbeat this film from pou soi cheang isn t really sleazy lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison however it still packs a punch that makes it worth a watch particularly if gritty hard edged action is your thing edison chen plays pang a cambodian hit man who travels to hong kong to assassinate the wife of a judge sam lee is wai the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down whatever the cost with wai closing in on his target pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escape until he meets yue a pretty illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life of abuse a relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography amazing sound design a haunting score and solid performances from chen and lee as well as newcomer pei pei as pang s love interest dog bite dog is one for fans of hard hitting asian hyper violence think along the lines of chan wook park s vengeance trilogy stabbings shootings merciless beatings all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director cheang of course this is the kind of tale that is destined to have an unhappy ending for all involved and sure enough pretty much everyone in this film dies rather nasty deaths unfortunately there is a fine line between tragedy and unintentional comedy and in its final moments dog bite dog crosses it in a laughably over dramatic final scene pang and wai are locked in battle as a pregnant yue looks on eventually after all three have suffered severe stab wounds during the fracas a wounded pang performs a diy ceasarean on a now dead yue delivering their baby moments before he himself dies whilst this film might not be a classic slice of hong kong excess with its deliriously ott action and stylish visuals it s still worth seeking out',\n","       'i saw the movie hoot and then i immediately decided to comment it the truth is that nature needs protection from us because we are the dominant specie of this planet some people think that if they have money they can do whatever they want to which probably is like

that care more about it then the adults do when i was twelve i saw some waterlilies and i knew they are protected by law and didn t even dare to touch them not fearing of the law but fearing that i

essence of the adventures of ast rix the french comic books it s based upon and to create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy which is also an homage to the world of animated films this movie is so funny so full of jokes both visual and spoken that it might take you two or three screenings before you notice them all between your bursts of laughter the only drawback is that a non french audience or at least a non french speaking audience might not get all the private jokes there are so many dialogues impossible to translate so many situations directly related either to the comic books or to the french way of life that the fun might be lessened however it s still totally worth seeing for the beautiful picture the amazing stunts the music the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting all actors are great but the film would not be the same without jamel debouze g rard darmon and edouard baer and please don t ever compare this magnificent film to the terrible

characters ever seen the writer obviously bought the playbook how to write a space disaster movie and followed it play by play in particular the stereo typical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space putting on a brave show in the face of disaster has been done time and time again max q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw 50 million at the project but judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects the producers could only muster 50 thousand to learn that the film was nominated for a special visual effects emmy has me absolutely gob smacked i think a handful of high school students with a pass in media studies could have created more believable effects and the plot holes are too numerous to mention but i will pick one out as an example now i m no nasa expert but surely it s highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pear shaped with the program surely there is someone more experienced at mission control who the program director would call on rather than a twenty nine year old who has not been in the control room before the only saving grace for this film is the work of bill campbell he manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script i give this film 2 out of 10 with the above average work of bill campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark',\n","       'i am not a big music video fan i think

at all but very methodical and a self promoter the director here plays viewer expectations and pulls it off the film is constructed as a murder mystery or a cold case style thriller it is an intelligent investigative procedural style horror film that will put off gore hounds in search of cheap thrills some people dislike any movie that is shot on video this attitude is very old style and provincial it is an attitude and view of movies that puts technical issues above entertainment value or artistic value these attitudes are on the way out zodiac killer is a low budget film no doubt

late night comedy recipe that will really turn your stomach i have watched the show never in its entirety but many times still it just creeps up on me after conan i usually watch a minute or two just

a grizzly middle aged fisherman who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family i think i have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years the best of which is lake placid

couple hours left until zero hour do yourself a favor and miss this movie you will make yourself stupider for having watched it the ending is particularly silly and should have been accompanied by

string and m theory what a brilliantly architected documentary starting with some helpful historical background you will be lead step by elegant step into a universe of pure magic and dimensions beyond i have always had a huge appreciation of mathematics this movie can easily give you an insight into what an exquisitely beautiful language mathematics is without making you feel like you re about to fail the grade the show is repetitive at times as the original format was a mini series split over three shows it therefore makes sense to give us polite little reminders of the principles being presented i found this immensely helpful as it kept reminding me of the multitude of questions and possible answers that make up this amazing tapestry of our very existence we are all and

more than a broad hint that there s a gay relationship going on between young steve and david clarke he s not liked at all by the other heist members mainly because of his lack of criminal resume steve also has a girl friend in molly mccarthy and she suspects something afoot especially when he starts hanging around with crahan denton and james dukas as well as clarke all pretty rough characters that would certainly get my suspicions aroused the great st louis bank robbery had two directors charles guggenheim and john stix guggenheim did mostly documentaries and stix didn t do much

from rosalba neri her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic she steals every scene she is in and expresses so much with her face and eyes even when she s not speaking her performance is very believable she manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top not that there s anything wrong with being over the top mark damon is surprisingly good in this movie too the music score is excellent and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie whether you want it to or not there are a couple of parts that are very amusing i especially like the part where rosalba neri undresses in front of the parrot there s also lots of slick gun play that s very well done i would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasn t for two things the first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about 25 minutes into the film this is one of the most ridiculous looking fights i have ever seen in a movie it is very poorly choreographed and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight one might be able to overlook this if it were a terence hill bud spencer comedy but this is a more serious western and the brawl really needed to be more realistic the other thing that annoyed me about this movie was yuma s cowardly mexican sidekick i guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this and he wasn t at all funny all i can say is where is tuco when you need him all that having been said

grave a cult have gathered with plans to resurrect him by peeing onto the grave this of course works and he awakes ripping the guys penis off and he is back into his old killing ways with an all new zombie look the two cops one of who is going a little crazy about the scum of the city and has a drug problem are back on the case two of the original cult member also tries to stop the killer by resurrecting some other kind of dead thing thinking they have filed they leave but out from the grave comes a plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection sounds a bit confusing really but no its just rubbish the acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy that plays dr vincent van gore in the faces of gore series and he is just as terrible as the annoying cop in this film the other cop just about struggles to get his terrible lines out now i m all for low budget cinema but this film is just terrible if it wasn t for the very easy on the eye ladies and their nakedness i would probably have fallen asleep there is a bit of gore but it s never more than some animal guts placed on the stomach of the victims the zombie makeup on the other hand looks great and his foot long penis that he uses to rape his victims with is kind of funny at times there is also a half decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll the doll with the chipmunks voice is the stupidest thing i have ever seen in a film it is just a plastic toy on a fishing line the ending is extremely bad you would expect the killer to put up much more of a fight than he does god

because she otherwise a good actress cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent brad johnson also an excellent actor is matt who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce he is gentle convincing and compelling in this role the two meet on the beach through her daughter pip and initially ophelia accuses matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid all of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love the chemistry between the two leads is not great even though the talent of these two people is not in my opinion a question they did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical two people meet tragedy bigger tragedy a secret is revealed another tragedy and then they get together i wish there was more to it than that but there it is in a nutshell i wanted mindless entertainment and i got it with this in regard to the genre of romantic films this one fails to be memorable a secret affair

get tiring and poor george burns has absolutely nothing to do except repeat gracie all the time i don t remember laughing at him once although he has one great scene with ruggles where ruggles tries desperately to get george to take gracie and leave him and his wife alone for a while and one with fields where he asks fields to sell him a sweater that bit is exclusively fields though the situation

installment of their silly symphonies series the skeleton dance iwerks and disney had been collaborating together since the early 20s in disney s laugh o gram cartoon series however their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when iwerks accepted an offer by a competitor to leave disney and start his own animation studio that was the birth of celebrity productions where iwerks continued developing his style and technique and where he created the character of flip the frog while his work kept the same high quality it wasn t really popular and by 1936 the studio was closed later that year iwerks was hired by columbia pictures and iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance this time in color 1937 s skeleton frolics is essentially a remake of the 1929 classic the skeleton dance the movie that borough him fame and fortune like that short film it is set on an abandoned graveyard where at midnight the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play the dead rise from their coffins ready for the show that s about to begin as a group of skeletons has formed an orchestra and begin to play a happy tune now it s not easy to be a musician made of just bones as some of the orchestra members have problems with their body parts however the band manages to put a good show and another group of skeletons begin to dance a lovely couple of them faces the same problems that troubled the orchestra it s hard to dance with loose body parts everything ends at dawn and just when the sun is about to rise again the skeletons run towards their graves directed and animated by ub iwerks himself skeleton frolics follows faithfully the pattern set by the skeleton dance years before although with a crucial difference iwerks did the whole film in technicolor the bright tonalities allowed iwerks to create a more visually appealing film and also to use the many new techniques he had been practicing since leaving disney creating even better effects of depth and dynamism than those he conceived before it is certainly a more experimental film than the skeleton dance although sadly this doesn t mean it s necessarily a better film for starters the film is practically identical to the one he did with disney with the only differences being the music more on that later and the color effects it looks beautiful no doubt about it but it definitely feels kind of unoriginal after all however it is not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurts the film after all iwerks executes it in a wonderful way but the fact that the musical melody created by joe denat for the film is pretty uninteresting and lacks the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one done by carl w stalling for the skeleton dance in other words while denat s tune is effective and appropriate for the theme it s easy to forget about it rapidly while stalling s song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable being a musical film this is of high importance and so the mediocrity of the music brings down iwerk s flawless work of animation personally i think that with a better musical accompaniment skeleton frolics would be remembered as fondly as the skeleton dance despite not being as groundbreaking as it s still a fun film to watch it s kind of sad that most of the work iwerks did after leaving disney is now forgotten due to his poor success however it must be said that if iwerks lacked the popularity of disney or fleischer disney s main rival he did not lack the quality of those companies films it was probably just a case of bad luck what made the man who gave life to disney s mouse for the first time to face failure out of disney despite its shortcomings skeleton frolics is a very funny and visually breathtaking film that while not exactly the most original and fresh film one just can t help but thinking of the skeleton dance while watching it it definitely reminds us that iwerk s skeletons are still here to haunt us and inspire us 8 10',\n","

have made for a far better film so why did they come up with this dishwater dull script i suppose there weren t enough naked people in the factual version it s hurriedly capped off in the end with a

here rather than looking at the rating of over 6 from a select choice of the ignorant viewing public i would not have seen this desecration alien was a fantastic dramatic and well made horror sci fi predator was a great sci fi action mess about i do really have only myself to blame though as i saw alien versus predator it too has an average grading of over 6 stars from the connoisseurs of film that frequent this site stop reading now if you have any fear of this ever so suspense ridden plot being ruined for you right from the beginning this film was ridiculous no explanation was offered for the predator ship overrun not overrun by aliens ok so maybe they were again going to throw aliens down to earth to hunt them and something went wrong but how did this result in an alien predator hybrid and why did the rest of the crew not realise sooner despite their great technology the start was actually the most coherent and interesting part of the film because we had some idea of who was who or what was what and perhaps why from then on it gets really ridiculous i always leave my disbelief strictly suspended above the door of the screen before entering and collect it on the way out i couldn t here a father and son are hunting in the woods the damaged ship crash lands to from the view given i would calculate at the very least 10 odd miles away through thick woodland the man and boy track there alone and find the ship and get face hugged even at this point you feel very little for them mainly because the face huggers are almost comical rather than scary in their movement and actions and the father seems like such an irresponsible dumb redneck muppet an edgy thriller type scenario is introduced with an ex con returning to the town near the crash site to be met by his somewhat emotionless dull now cop friend from the bus when i say introduced i mean a feeble attempt with crap actors and no feeling is played out a slasher horror element is then introduced with a sexy girl and the usual supposedly nerdy or somehow undesirable cute guy who gets beaten up by the over protective crazy nasty jock type american sportsman not a scottish man oh the cute not cute boy is the ex con s brother by the way yes they re clever these director brothers whose name i will research in order to avoid any other shite they put out again then a modern role reversal oh so boring attempt at pc ripley credential type character introduction comes with a female soldier returning home to her husband and child guess what happens next i won t tell you much more about the actual smiles sadly to himself about the demise of storytelling in the large majority of recent films plot just in case you have got this far and are not the brightest star in the alien ridden universe the predator is stupid for the reasons stated by the previous poster whose post i read too late the aliens are boring the predator alien is ridiculous the action is at times exploitative gratuitous disgusting nonsense the hospital scene with the pregnant mothers oh i was shocked alright shocked at how low some people will go to get what a scare some shock to titillate the perverse what if you really wanted to shock titillate and scare people who are not pregnant or expecting fathers or who have no souls why not just have the alien predator shagging the saucy women and teenage girls rather than killing them the characters have no depth and neither does the plot it s filmed and paced badly it s acted by disinterested people not that i can blame them it further tarnishes two rather interesting and good sets of sci fi characters this film was rubbish and if you gain enjoyment from it i really have to worry about you if you haven t seen it then well please make your own decision ps did i even mention the way that trained soldiers are all killed in about 20 seconds while amateur civilians survive throughout',\n","       'flynn known mostly for his swashbuckling roles and his bedroom antics takes a different tack with this film and it works beautifully playing real life boxing champ jim corbett flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from a stifled san francisco bank teller to a celebrated pugilist all the while setting one eye on society deb smith he and best pal carson attend an illegal bare knuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men and a dog including a prominent judge the next day he gets a chance via smith to gain entrance to the judge s private club he uses this opportunity to weasel his way into the good graces of its exclusive members and land a spot as the club s resident boxer his unusually adept skill in the sport soon has him taking on all comers up to and including the world champion john l sullivan bond flynn is downright magical here he is the epitome of charm charisma and appeal in this role he looks terrific especially in a hangover scene with his hair mussed and wearing a white union suit and does virtually all of his own stuntwork impressively his line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is a good match for flynn at this stage he needed a female costar who could stand up to his advances and reputation he was undergoing statutory rape charges at the time and she does so admirably she is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell bond is incredibly burly brawny and towering yet tender when the script calls for it amusing support is provided by a young and ebullient carson frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as flynn s manager the rest of the cast is excellent as well including flynn s rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy nob hill types the whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed a few of the sets are amazingly presented some of smith s gowns border on the garish but she suits the upswept hairstyles very well it s a terrific glimpse into the earliest days of championship boxing but it s also so much more some of it like the character traits shown by flynn is enhanced or exaggerated for entertainment purposes but a lot of it is authentic like the methods and costumes shown in the fight scenes one line is particularly memorable i believe you like

second viewing a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentation spoiler of sorts follows poor cedric he apparently didn t know what hit him poor audience we were at first caught up in what seemed a really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch these two guys just didn t belong together from their first ambiguous encounter as much as mathieu and cedric were sexually attracted to each other the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for mathieu an intellectual being to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more attuned to carnival festivities and romps on the beach on a purely technical note i loved the camera action in this film subtitles were totally unnecessary even though my french is presque rien i could watch it again without the annoying english translation and enjoy it even more this was a polished very professionally made motion picture though many scenes seem superfluous i rate it nine out of ten',\n","       'i think this is one hell of a moviewe can see steven fighting around with his martial art stuff again and like in all segal movies there s a message

being a male i m probably not qualified to totally understand it but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive victorian environment from the start it isn t as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher what makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters each has their own thing that they contend with once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion what i enjoyed about this movie is that it didn t go for cheap comedy when it could have it didn t try to pound a lesson into us the people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light i did have a little trouble with the alfred molina character having such an epiphany so quickly but within this world it needed to happen good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people',\n","       'i like

gotta turn the clock back to the time when the writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories now this one very rare pilot episode for the tv series ghost story called the new house was one of the most scariest films i ever saw it was on once in 1972i was only 9but nothing since then even compared to it with all the remake going on in hollywood some one should do this one as is with no more special efx than the original this episode was down right creepy as hell i m lucky to find it finally on dvd today and very rare and hard to find the only other 2

and recycle an idea doesn t necessarily make lightning strike twice the halperin brothers responsible for the horror classic white zombie made this trite piece of garbage a mere few years later to cash in on its popularity and even recycled close ups of lugosi s eyes from that previous film there was a court battle with the white zombie film s rights owners who didn t want the halperins to be able to use the word zombie in this title that word was the only thing that could help this film because as everyone knows bad films can make much more money simply by having the word zombie appear in the title knowing what victor halperin was capable of a few years before only makes this uninteresting film more insulting it seems he never directed another horror film after this debacle the zombies here seem not to be true walking dead but simply hypnotism victims wanna create a mind controlled army of zombies be ready to crack a few eggs including your own the lame plot man falls in love with scheming woman who plays with his heart and becomes engaged to him only to make his friend whom she loves jealous this sends man into a spiral of madness in which he tries using zombie mind control techniques to change things to his advantage in an attempt to win over a woman who isn t worth spit this includes one of the most blatantly obvious plot developments i ve ever seen you d have to be blind or stupid not to see the ending coming the acting isn t even good this movie makes the racially insensitive king of the zombies which appeared on the same double bill dvd i bought seems like an atmospheric horror masterpiece by comparison and reminds us that not every black and white film is a classic it makes the atomic age sci fi alien zombie cheese fest invisible invaders seem like a serious drama this is one big ball of cheese so ridiculously melodramatic it could probably make many a korean film fan twitch south korean films are often known for their use of melodrama the credits

of india the film tells the real life scenario of mumbai police of the 70s unlike any police of other cities in india mumbai police encompasses a different system altogether govind nihalani creates a very practical outlay with real life approach of mumbai police environment amongst various police officers colleagues the film describes the story of anand velankar a young hot blooded cop coming from a poor family his father is a harsh police constable anand himself suffers from his father s ideologies incidences of his father s atrocities on his mother anand s approach towards immediate action against crime is an inert craving for his own job satisfaction the film is here revolved in a plot wherein anand s constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniorsthis leads to frustrations as he cannot achieve the desired job satisfaction resulting from the frustrations his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms bars also turning him to an alcoholic the spirit within him is still alive as he constantly fights the system he is aware of the system of the metro where the police politicians are a inertly associated by far end his compromise towards unethical practice is negative finally he gets suspended the direction is a master piece thoroughly hard core one of the best memorable scenes is when anand breaks in the underworld gangster rama shetty s house to arrest him followed by short conversation which is fantastic at many scenes the film has hair raising moments the practical approach of script is a major punch alcoholism corruption political

and acted that it beggars belief it should be remade with a better script director and casting service the worst problem is the acting you have jennifer beals on the one hand who is polished professional and totally believable and on the other hand ri chard who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece peter gallagher and jenny levine are just awful as the slave owning and keeping couple although both normally do fine work the actors and director should not have attempted to do accents at all they are inconsistent and unbelievable much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual english the casting is ludicrous why have children of an african merchant thus less socially desirable to the gens de couleur society been cast with very pale skinned actors while the supposedly socially desirable marcel has pronounced african features including an obviously dyed blond fro it s as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color it s just so weird this could be a great movie and should be re made but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors there are plenty of good actors out there and it would be fun to see how jennifer beals daniel sunjata and gloria reuben

my chest i m a huge fan of john eyres first film project shadowchaser the film a b grade cross of both the terminator die hard may not be the work of a cinematic genius but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit spawned two sequels a spin off judge and jury begins with joseph meeker a convicted killer who was sent to death row following his capture after the so called bloody shootout which seems like a poor name for a killing spree meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store being led to the electric chair there is an amusing scene where meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love who was killed during the shootout expressing his revenge for the person who killed her michael silvano a washed up football star who spends his days watching his son alex practicing football with his high school team and ends up harassing his son s coach but once executed meeker returns as a revenant or as kelly perine calls a hamburger without the fries whose sole aim is to get his revenge which basically means making silvano s life a misery let me point out the fact that judge and jury is not a true horror film it is a supernatural action film with meeker chasing silvano using his ability to change form which amounts to david keith dressing up as everything from an elvis impersonator a french chef with an accent as bad as his moustache a drag queen a clown a stand up comedian a shotgun which fires explosive rounds an invulnerability to death although that doesn t stop martin kove from shooting keith with a desert eagle to pay silvano back for killing meeker s wife director john eyres does not seem interested in characterisations instead focusing solely on action scenes which the film has plenty of but that is the film s main flaw since there s nothing to connect the action scenes together the acting is surprisingly good with keith delivering the best performance supported ably by kove as well as paul koslo who plays the washed up cop quite well kelly perine is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse',\n","       'i laughed all the way through this rotten movie

afterwards i can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film it s great to see jbeals but she s only in the movie for a few minutes mparker is a much better actress than the part allowed for the rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable the main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch there is no real emotional depth to the story a movie revolving about an actor who can t get work doesn t feel very original to me nor does the development of the cop it feels like one of many

of the old star wars with yoda obee one and vader the spider machine in the beginning was exactly like frodo being attacked by the spider in return of the kings elijah wood is the victim in both films and waitit hypnotizes stings its victim and wraps them upuh hello and the whole machine vs humans theme was the matrixor terminator there are more examples but why waste the time and will someone tell

bronson is a retired hit man who isn t giving up his retirement for anything until someone shows him a video tape featuring interviews with the victims of the doctor not the legendary time traveler but a infamous expert on torture it s never really explained why the doctor is so infamous since any police state has a myriad of these sadists nor is it explained why the doctor and his sister have ridiculous english accents as you may guess it s a lazily written movie and incidents happening because the screenwriter needs things to happen to further the plot no matter how unlikely they are like one of the bad guys getting invited to a threesome so he can be killed or things being revealed like the doctor s sister being a lesbian so some t a can be included in many ways it s like one of those nasty chuck norris vehicles that were being released at the same time but the most disappointing thing is that the director is also the same man who made ice cold in alex and the guns of naverone two

depardieu at his finest and robespierre a commanding performance by the polish actor wojciech pszoniak the moderate revolutionary danton has returned to paris from his country seat where he has been since being deposed as leader of the committee of public safety in the previous year by robespierre he is opposed to the reign of terror which has resulted in the executions of thousands of citizens mainly by guillotine who are thought to be opposed to the revolution danton is confident of the support of the ordinary people and tries to persuade robespierre to curb the bloodletting but robespierre and the committee are afraid that the popularity of danton will lead to them being overthrown and put danton and his supporters on trial for being traitors this was the first french language film made by andrzej wajda after he had arrived in france from poland his polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support for the solidarity trade union which had opposed the polish government in the late seventies and early eighties his previous film man of iron 1981 had dealt with the solidarity union and its leader lech walesa and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship of walesa and the polish leader general jaruselski and that between danton and robespierre danton walesa are the voice of reason opposed to robespierre jaruselski who continue dictatorial rule despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent the film is based on the polish play the danton affair written by stanislawa przybyszewska in the 1930s and on its release the film was criticised by some for being static and theatrical but what the film does is to concentrate on the behind the scenes meetings of the committees and the scenes in

worked quite well in that role along with kasey i think her let me dance for you scene is one of the best parts of the movie a worthwhile addition compared to the musical the dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger easier to do in the movie of course the decors lighting dancing and singing are also much superior in the movie which should be expected and was indeed delivered the songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie the new ones are quite good ones and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion especially compared to a musical which has few decors the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters but their dancing is impeccable and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical',\n","       'some films just simply should not be remade

cast holds up with the exception of owen wilson who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson

themselves at him and the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly soon the object is in the open the mystery continues though as the object generates a huge amount of electricity it is decided to open the object but just before that is done julian decodes the signal do not open but too late and the object explodes as it is finally breached and two things unleashed on earth the first is an alien that had been dormant in the object and the other is a virus that instantly kills the research staff and washington that is suspiciously updated on this historic event decides that those things can not be unleashed upon the earth so a russian nuclear submarine carrying nuclear weapons is sent to antarctica comments the movie holds a few surprises one is carl lewis who surprisingly puts in a good acting performance and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful well worked through and a lot better than expected unfortunately the story holds a lot of surprises of its own and this time not in a good way actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes it is never really explained why washington know so much why washington is able to command russian submarines why the object is in the antarctic and has woken up now it is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable english some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to earth before and knew the language and obviously chose english why but then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the earth from the virus send their do not open message encoded and finally the end is as open as an end can be the movie is a little entertaining but too much energy from me must be diverted to fill in the voids in the plot therefore the total impression of the movie is not too good 3 10',\n","       'basically there s a family where a little boy jake thinks there s a zombie in his closet his parents are fighting all the time this movie is slower than a soap opera and suddenly jake decides to become rambo and kill the zombie ok first of all when you re going to make a film you must decide if its a thriller or a drama as a drama the movie is watchable parents are divorcing arguing like in real life and then we have jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film i expected to see a boogeyman similar movie and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots 3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents descent dialogs

chaplin leads his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial english town until the stunningly gorgeous wild girl to die for nadia nicole kidman ordered by email from russia enters his life to become his beloved wife by johns plan however a glitch turns up nadia does not speak a word of johns language although calm and emotionless on the outside john becomes so interested in beautiful nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process what happens henceforth in the plot really shakes poor john from his slumber of a decently paid safe feeling clerk into a decision making decently thinking action figure giving the viewer a subliminal message you would have probably acted likewise kidman cassel kassovitz make a great team acting russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing almost only due to the slight accent present in their russian dialogues however slight enough to amaze a native russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right nicole kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles at least from the cultural background the pace of the film is fast and captivating and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear you rather feel that you re in the middle of the plot and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out my advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy to sum it up it has an unusual plot great acting and ideas below the surface like the idea of the rude awakening from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a society s machine the life which members of the fight club were so keen to quit and the machine of which pink floyd sings welcome to the machine i bet that in the end john was rather off with sophia on their way to the unknown than not having met her at all thank you writers for the great story and everyone else for this great movie please make a sequel and you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the 999999 percent of the potential viewers i am sure of it',\n","       'in all honesty i haven t seen this film for many years but the few times i have tend to make parts of it stick in my memory as anyone who has seen it will understand i first saw it as a child at a ymca halloween party in the early sixties and it scared the hell out of us kids in a fun way i remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze i can t risk giving away the ending except to say that it was surprising to say the least i remember vaguely the entire audience of young boys letting out a big scared holler followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed the ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny climaxes to a movie in film history and yet oddly moving in a way you have to see it for yourself which is not easy these days i don t know if it s available on home video or not but it would still make a great halloween feature for both kids and adults',\n","       'what happened what we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast but somewhere the movie loses it actually it never

usually brings a lot to a movie was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie other than to make it longer i really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters kate and angie and maybe try not for a pure comedy which unfortunately it was not but maybe a drama with comedic elements i think if the movie did this it

silences and a lot of slow movement the acting was absolutely terrible bordering on bad student film levels while everyone struggled to ad lib something called a script did these people even get any

plot and over the top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large scale combat once in a while however a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen the civil war era cold mountain starring jude law nicole kidman and ren e zellweger is such a film then again calling cold mountain a war movie is not entirely accurate true enough the film opens with a quite literally quick and dirty battle sequence that puts glory director edward zwick shame however cold mountain is not so much about the civil war itself as it is about the period and the people of the times the story centers around disgruntled confederate soldier inman played by jude law who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of cold mountain north carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind ada monroe played by nicole kidman at first glance this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier s tribulations on the battlefield indeed the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived cold mountain soon takes a drastic turn though as the intrepid hero inman turns out to be a deserter incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the confederates and begins a long odyssey homeward meanwhile back at the farm ada s cultured ways prove of little use in the fields soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast coming to ada s rescue is the course tough as nails ruby thewes played by ren e zellweger who helps ada put the farm back together and perhaps more importantly cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon ada within these two settings a vivid compelling and at times very disturbing portrait of the war torn south unfolds the characters with whom inman and ada interact are surprisingly complex enhanced by wonderful performances of brendan gleeson as ruby s deadbeat father ray winstone as an unrepentant southern lawman and natalie portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother all have been greatly affected and changed by the war of northern aggression mostly for the worse the dark pervading anti war message accented by an effective haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of virginia and north carolina is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century it s hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant director anthony minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters the love story between inman and ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film though the inherently distant abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot make no mistake cold mountain has neither the traits of a feel good romance nor an inspiring war drama it is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether',\n","

evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations this is boldness at work pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent this is the best movie of the year to date i ve read numerous complaints about this film anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting to negatively criticize this film is to miss the point this movie may be a landmark a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow the cell has just opened the door to another world of imagination so can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director tarsem singh that we don t want any more personally i would more than welcome another movie by tarsem and would love to see someone try to challenge him we ve all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer and yes i do agree that the genre is a bit overworked the 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick some of them worked but most failed but the cell does not blaze down the same trail we are given a new twist we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied i like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how jennifer lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another instead she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long twizzlers and jaunted into another entity the cell wants to let you see what it s all about and not how it s all about and i guess that s what some people don t like true i do like explanations with my movies but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in i noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another nonetheless the set design was simply astonishing i wouldn t be surprised if this film took home a few oscars in cinematography best costumes best director and the like if it were up to me it d at least get nominated for best picture i ve noticed that i ve kind of been repeating myself not because there s nothing else to say but because i can t stress enough how fantastic i thought the cell was if you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eye popping feast then you are assured a good time i guess this film was just a little too much for some people writing it off as weird or crazy i am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind so it was right down my alley leaving the theater i heard one audience member say whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs if so i want what he was smoking out of 4',\n","       'this show was an amazing fresh innovative idea in the 70 s when it first aired the first 7 or 8 years were brilliant but

has fallen the writing is painfully bad the performances are almost as bad if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guest hosts this show probably wouldn t still be on the air i find it so hard to believe that the same creator that hand selected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed how can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity i felt i must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success as it is now the show is just awful i can t believe it s still on the air',\n","

who takes in a creepy lodger who just happens to be a flesh eater who then infects the old lady who also turns into a flesh eating zombie or ghoul quite which exactly is not defined there is pathos in the story as her son realises what she has become and while at first horrified attempts to help her by supplying food i shall say no more about that for fear of inserting a spoiler it is one of those quiet movies as opposed to guns blasting explosions raging car chases etc boring etc that makes so many movies all the same rubbish but still with enough gory moments to satisfy horror fans whilst also inserting sadness into the story along with nice touches of humour as opposed to downright silliness of some so called horror movies there is a particularly nice atmospheric shot at the beginning of the film where the old lady is sitting alone in her room with only her christmas tree for company and looks so innocent but what she becomes oh my a gem of a movie and even if not your thing should

achingly tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorms that are strangely never actually heard in the house great double glazing the house that is apparently only a few miles from a town yet is several hours walk away or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable or even the beginning which suggests a spate of 20 killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never ventures far from the house or the bizarre ritual with the salt pepper that pretty much sums up most of the films inherent lack of direction add a lead actress who can t act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is truly nasty but not in the way you hope given a following simply for being banned in the uk in the 80 s mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder it offers nothing but curiosity value and one classic daft murder don t worry its telegraphed at least ten minutes before after a walk in the woods our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe what do they do slide down and run

this site but this film is very deserving because of how poorly it was created and how bias its product was i felt a distinct attempt on the part of the film makers to display the palestinian family as boorish and untrustworthy we hear them discuss the sadness that they feel from oppression yet the film is shot and arranged in a way that we feel the politically oppressed population is the jewish israeli population we see no evidence that parallels the position of the palestinian teenager we only hear from other palestinians in prison i understand restrictions are in place but the political nature of the restrictions are designed to prevent peace i came out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence so to speak she continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bomber s parents and her angry and closed minded words caused the final meeting to spiral out of control it is more realistic in my mind to see the israeli mindset to be a root of the problem ignored pleas for understanding and freedom ignored requests for acknowledgment for the process by which the jewish population acquired the land i have given this a two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother which normally would be admirable in a documentary however in the light of the lack of impartiality it all seems exploitative also for the poor edits lack of background in the actual instance and finally the lack of proper representation of the palestinian side ultimately it is a poor documentary and a poor film

to an a list actor with box office draw which is probably why i never heard of this film before i saw it donald sutherland is great as the morally ambiguous somewhat creepy at times agent that recruits quinn ben kingsley is fine also as the israeli agent the plot is very complex and there are multiple story lines which converge in gradual fashion toward the end and not all at once as we re used to seeing the paranoia and claustrophobia of these type of thrillers is captured and portrayed with both moral ambiguity and frightening intensity the locations are convincing and effective the soundtrack is nothing special but rarely do we get all of the above mentioned qualities these days without dumb and or meaningless plot developments unconvincing star turns loud annoying music video

age there may be worse movies i ve seen but thankfully i can t remember them the sets appeared to be made with cardboard and finished with cans of spray paint the special effects looked like a fifth

loves his mammaonly he d love her better six feet under in this dark laugh out loud comedy that both stars and is directed by danny devito with admirable assists from billy crystal and anne ramsey in the title role throw momma from the train is a terrific comedy even if it isn t a great film it s too shallow in parts and the ending feels less organic than tacked on but it s a gut splitting ride most of the way with crystal and devito employing great screen chemistry while working their own separate comic takes on the essence of being a struggling writer devito is avid but untalented crystal is blocked and bitter crystal s professor donner believes his ex wife stole his book the unfortunately titled hot fire and can t write more than the opening line of his next book which doesn t come easy he teaches a creative writing class of budding mediocrities including a middle aged woman who writes tom clancy type fiction but doesn t know what that thing is the submarine captain speaks through and an upholstery salesman who wants to write the story of his life mr pinsky is probably the funniest character for laughs per minutes on screen an ascot wearing weirdo who sees literature as an excuse to write his opus 100 girls i d like to pork then there s devito s owen lift who calls himself professor donner s star pupil even though the teacher won t read his work in class owen is a somewhat unusual character to star in a movie a man child in his late 30s who lives with his overbearing mother anne ramsey who calls him lardass and other endearing sentiments in any other movie we d be asked to feel sorry for owen but throw momma from the train piles life s cruelties onto this sad sack for laughs and expects us to go along that s one big reason why this film probably loses a lot of people for those of us who enjoy the humor of this character even identifying with him and take the rest of what we see here as a lark it s not as big a stretch to go along with the bigger gambit this comedy takes asking us to watch in amusement while owen enlists professor donner s help in a plan to kill his mother actually he first goes to hawaii to kill donner s hated ex then tells the professor it s his turn to kill mrs lift swapping murders as seen in hitchcock s strangers on a train as a director devito not only complements his actors performances with scene setting that places the accent on dialogue he makes some bold visual statements throwing in bits of amusing unreality to keep the audience on its toes and away from taking things too seriously also helping matters is writer stu silver who keeps the laughs coming with his quotable patter you got rats the size of oldsmobiles here she s not a womanshe s the terminator one little murder and i m jack the ripper those are all crystal s words but some of the funniest lines which work only in context but absolutely kill are devito s and ramsey s apparently silver never wrote another screenplay after this according to the imdb and that s a shame because he had real talent for it the best scene in this movie when crystal meets ramsey was actually used in its entirety as a theatrical coming attraction presentation the only time i ve seen a movie promoted that way owen introduces the professor to his mother as cousin patty and when momma says he doesn t have a cousin patty panicky owen loses it you lied to me he yells out slamming the professor s forehead with a pan of course in reality the professor wouldn t groan out something witty from the floor but throw momma from the train works effectively at such moments when playing its looney tunes vibe for all its worth devito hasn t disappeared from films of course but it s a mystery why he hasn t really followed up on the directorial promise of this movie maybe it s because as throw momma from the train s lack of mainstream success shows his kind of vision isn t to everyone s tastes that s too bad for those of us who can watch this over and over and

like raptors because they are scary my favorite parts are the ones where the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the friday the 13th movie with the girl who eats the banana i really love to watch a lot of this movie because the computer graphics seem a little fake but it s okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what is going on and i think it s got a good ending even though i didn t really understand what was going on on my first couple viewings i figured it out over time and that s the important part the other important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if you re watching it the first time this is best movie',\n","       'empire of passion starts out deceptively that is if you re immediately expecting it to be a horror movie it s like a riff on james m cain s the postman always rings twice at first seki kazuko yoshiyuki is a mother of two and a dutiful hard working wife to rickshaw driver gisaburo takahiro tamura but when he s not around and she s at home with the baby the feisty and aimless young man toyoji tatsuya fuji comes around to bring some goodies for seki and a little extra they re soon sleeping together but after he does something to her let s just say a shave he knows that he ll find out and immediately proposes that they kill gisaburo they drink him up strangle him and then toss him down a well naturally this will come back to haunt them but that it s literally at least to them at first super terrified seki and then only later on skeptical toyoji changes gears into the kaidan a japanese ghost story this is a film where the horror comes not simply out of oh ghost ah but out of the total dread that builds for the characters in a way there s the mechanics of a film noir at work throughout if only loosely translated by way of a 19th century japanese village as opposed to an american city or small town ie the snooping cop the evidence found possibly by another word getting around suspicions aroused etc it s compelling because seiko actually was against the plan from the start manipulated by the lustful but ill prepared toyoji and her reactions to gisaburo s re appearances are staggering to her take the one that comes closest to poetry gisaburo s ghost pale blue face and mostly silent chilling stare motions for seiko to get on the rickshaw she does reluctantly and he pushes her around on a road she doesn t know in the wee hours before dawn surrounded by smoke most japanese ghost stories wish to heavens they could get this harrowingly atmospheric while it starts to veer into hysterics towards the end there s so much here that director oshima gets right in making this a distinctive work after hitting it huge in the international cinema world with in the realm of the senses which ironically got banned in his own country he made something that he claimed was even more daring that senses maybe he was right empire of passion has less graphic sexual content by far than its predecessor also starring tatsuya fuji a magnificently physical actor with an immense lot of range but its daring lies in crafting a world of dread you can believe in ghosts in this story but you also have to believe how far down to their own personal hells these two would be lovebirds will go the snooping detective or the gossiping townspeople are the least of their worries the fate of their very souls is at stake and oshima takes what in other hands could be merely juicy pulp sadly it wouldn t surprise me if an american remake was already in the works and crafts shot after gorgeous shot with repetition working its way into the mis en scene ie the shots of seiko and toyoji walking on that road the camera at a dutch angle the world tilted and surrounding them in a grim blue hue as well as some affecting movements that will stay with me long after i finish typing this ie toyoji throwing the leaves by one hand into the well in slow motion or how seiko s nude body is revealed after she becomes blind it s daring lies in connecting on a level of the spirit not to be confused with the spiritual though there may be something with that as well about life and death s connections to one another inextricably it s a classic waiting to be discovered',\n","       'ye lou s film purple butterfly pits a secret organization purple butterfly against the japanese forces in war torn shanghai ding hui zhang ziyi and her ex lover hidehiko itami toru nakamura find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance meeting i agree with the reviewer from paris the film substitutes a convoluted semi historical conflict for a plot without giving the audience a single reason to care about the characters or their causes the sudden time shifting doesn t help matters as it appears completely unwarranted and pointless normally i don t mind dark movies but the absence of light the bone jarringly shaky camera footage and the generally bad film making techniques really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in i also agree with the viewer from georgia that this film has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography but i don t think that helps the movie the backdrop to the film is one of the most potent events of the 20th century and i don t believe you can do it any justice by editing it as if it were a michael bay film the overly melodramatic moments don t add to its watchability the actors are all suitably melancholy zhang ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films brooding and looking generally annoyed however at least she adds some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst love making scene since michael biehn and linda hamilton in the terminator all in all a very disappointing film especially seeing as how it comes from the director of suzhou he 2

inexpensive dvd of this julie andrews blake edwards opus i decided to purchase and watch it once and for all boy what a terrible film it s so bad and on so many levels that i really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong looking at it now it s obvious to any fans of movies that blake edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with andrews in musicals mary poppins sound of music thoroughly modern millie etc but also because andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by julie herself camelot my fair lady etc because hollywood thought she wasn t sexy or glamorous enough so blake created this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story war movie romance slapstick comedy musical darling lili suffers from multiple personalities never knowing who or what it is some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole it just doesn t work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing mind you the version on the dvd is the director s cut or in this case let s salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop in releasing the dvd edwards cut 19 scenes 19 from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version the film moves along with no idea of what it is we are 25 minutes into it and we still don t know what s going on or why we re watching what s going what kind of spy is lili how powerful is she was she ever responsible for someone s death instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking rock hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking julie andrews things aren t helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love why does julie fall for hudson why him and not other men she got involved with there should have been one of her ex hanging around trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret this would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action it would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings there s no catalyst in this story one only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by andrews and edwards previous successes the best or worst example is the scene when andrews and hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest edwards channeling sound of music it s no wonder he removed it from the dvd back in 1970 that scene might have worked on a certain level but today that moment reeks of desperation there are other plot elements directly inspired by andrews edwards other films the endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better modern millie the musical moment i ll give you three guesses was created just to make fun of julie s mary poppins persona which is turned raunchy with julie doing a striptease in the act the ending bird s eye view of julie running towards hudson s plane is another wink at sound of music the whole thing is confusing julie plays a singer born from a german father and british mother who lives in england but sings her english songs in paris you never know exactly where the story takes place some moments are just badly edited like when julie and her uncle are on horseback they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprints off in mid sentence i m like what happened here the comedy bits are unfunny and cringe worthy every scene with the french police are pathetic where s peter sellers when you really need him the action is stupid beyond belief when julie and her uncle are on their way to germany on that train hudson s squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train almost killing lili in the process brilliant what s also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning that s one slow moving train there the musical moments the beginning is the best part of the entire film and the reason i gave this film 3 stars but it s effect is diminished considerably because it s repeated at the end speaking of redundant did we really need to see a can can dance crepe suzette stripping scene and julie stripping too the girl in no man s land is ok even if it s bleeding obvious but that moment just doesn t make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a french hospital making me wonder how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying the whole project is listless and without energy the romance is 100 unbelievable rock hudson is way too old and tired looking check out the museum scene julie looks dazed like she s on valium but what really kills this ill conceived project is julie playing a german spy edwards desperately wanted to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision as much as i like julie she s no greta garbo who pulled it off so beautifully in mata hari funny enough even if julie plays a german spy she still comes across as cloying and cute how bad is darling lili even after 37 years since its release blake edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its dvd release',\n","       'i really like salman kahn so i was really disappointed when

salman does a lot better on his next movie thank you',\n","       'i have just given a 10 for thieves highway i mention this for two reasons one to prove i m not a git who only gives bad reviews but 2 because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with a woman of the night we all know pretty woman is a chick flick but you can t avoid them all they ll eventually get you pretty woman for me does two things two terrible horrible ghastly things firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer you know with absolutely great friends leg warmers lots of giggling borrowing each others make up you see in the reality of pretty woman the prostitute and this is a street walker prostitute we re talking about here has a great life she s healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament my feeling is this happy hooker type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it if i make a film about a chef but don t want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place by bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have what a cop out really really lame secondly pretty woman insults romance itself edward lewis played by richard gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this lady that is without his plastic friend yep don t leave home without it especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another even when he first meets her it s the lotus esprit turbo that does all the work necklaces here diamonds there limos over there money money money where s the charm where s the charisma don t mention that attempt at the piano please girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most guys who like this film will not even have realized that old eddy has less charm than a calculator as they probably don t either so it wont have registered more importantly anyone who likes this film will hate thieves highway a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject i ll finish on a song pretty woman hangin round the street pretty woman the kind i like to treat pretty woman i don t believe you you re not the truth no one could spend as much as you mercy pretty woman wont you pardon me pretty woman i couldn t help but see pretty woman and you look lovely as can be do you lack imagination just like me pretty woman shop a while pretty woman talk a while pretty woman sell your smile to me pretty woman yeah yeah yeah pretty woman look my way pretty woman say you ll stay with meand i ll pay youi ll treat you right',\n","       'the premise of this movie was decent enough but with sub par acting it was just bland and dull spoilers the film does not work because of the nature of the death it was accidental so although it was a murder it wasn t like the guy set out to do it also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree there is no emotion in this film the first 20 minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister and hearing her message it was dull and boring with some polishing and better acting it could have been pretty good',\n","       'an extremely down to earth well made and acted rodeo western no gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60 s and 70 s west but hats off particularly to slim pickens for giving what i think was his signature performance especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life his role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the ups and downs of the hard nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style he and mr coburn teamed up extremely well as partners not only on the circuit itself but also in the real world outside the corral also check out anne archer as coburn s native american love interest in the latter part of the movie must have been one of her first roles not as flashy perhaps as junior bonner but equally heart rendering and impacting

quirky cultish film instead we have a group of self obsessed saddos and a plot which has been so done to bits i m suprised it hasn t been banned x and y are friends x is sleeping with z y sleeps with z as well oh you figure it out a total waste of time painful dialogue it sounded like something that a group of 16 year olds would have written for a gcse drama project the female character was completely superfluous just written in as a token female in the hope that women would be cajoled into seeing it if you re the sort of thicko lad who laughs at beer adverts and can usually be found

fire from wobbly garbled beginning to profound end this movie will entertain throughout our movie begins in the woods of a country somewhere in the world a family is hiding from unmarked soldiers in costume shop uniforms when the father separates from the mother and their childen you get a real sense of what kind of movie you re about to watch father makes sure to roll down hills in his all white outfit and is polite as he gets people s attention before he shoots them but alas dad is burned alive in what looks like a very unsupervised unsafe stunt meanwhile mom and the kids are running down a beach with an armed soldier trailing about 5 feet behind them he too gives a stern warning before action in the form of a bizarre halt and then promptly wastes the mother this action sequence sets up the happy childhood of our heroes bo and ingred so now we fast forward about 20 years 30 if you re honest about the hero s age to beautiful turkey where bo and ingred have settled as professional thieves or diamond prospectors or something ingred works at a diamond mine where she helps herself to the goods while bo masterfully played by the dynamic robert ginty drives around the desert in his denim outfits bo and ingrid have an interesting relationship they don t seem to have any friends other than each other and they spend all of their time together that coupled with the fact that bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister as evidenced in lines such as you know its a shame you re my sister he says to her while she s stark naked make for a very dynamic duo bo is then crushed when ingrid is killed as he wanders the beaches of turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf a renewal of hope occurs when bo finds a girl who looks like ingrid and gives her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like ingrid this opens the door for bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong bo is a real fan of ethical grey areas and he is overjoyed with his new love so anyway there s a lot of fun action scenes ridiculous violence great acting impossible to follow plot lines fred the hammer williamson for some reason and a big chunk of dirty ice which is supposed to be a giant diamond which later explodes all of these things are great but the bo and ingrid relationship is what makes this movie specialreally special so i heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that is white fire you may be glad you didor not',\n","       'the message of a world on the brink of war is disregarded by the masses the mythical city of everytown in 1940 represents england in general but it could just as well stand for any nation of the world when war finally does arrive it s ravages continue not for another five years but until 1966 at which time everytown is completely destroyed adding to the desolation and toll on humanity is the wandering sickness a pestilence that continues for another four years things to come balances both a fatalistic and futuristic world view where science holds out a hope for a revived civilization the wings over the world concept plays out a bit corny though it s spokesman cabal raymond massey is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause if he fails others will follow this message is continually reinforced throughout the film brought home convincingly in massey s end of movie speech man s insatiable need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires an all the universe or nothing mindset the film s imagery of automation and machinery in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent film metropolis as everytown is rebuilt and transformed by the year 2036 the spectacle of the city s rebirth strikes a resonant chord as architecture of modern cities of today suggest the movie s eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition where the movie gets it wrong by sixty seven years though is man s first mission to the moon but in 1936 a hundred year timetable probably seemed more legitimate than 1969 things to come is one of those rarities in film a picture that makes you think which side will you come down on the forces for advancement in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status

think she is worth all 10 or so of her oscar nominations about the film well there were a couple of interesting things i don t know much about australia but the theme of religious bigotry among the

was 6 years old you do the math i absolutely loved it i was tarzan for the 2 weeks after seeing it climbing the furniture jumping around making monkey sounds it started a fascination with tarzan and monkeys but oddly enough a longer lasting love for christopher lambert keep in mind that i saw highlander very shortly after this 1984 was the last time i saw that film until about a month ago it happened to be on cable as i was getting ready for bed at 330 am and even though it was late and i was tired and i had to be at work at 900 am i stayed up to watch this movie that i loved as a kid upon viewing it i realized that it was not that great of a film and even odder then that that andie macdowell s voice was dubbed by someone else ian holme was of course solid as usual and surprisingly the monkey suits still kind of held up but what was most surprising was how good lambert was as tarzan he was great the depth he managed to capture in so few lines his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark were just amazing as i stated earlier i am lambert fan but i m used to highlander the hunted and fortress in this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again so to make a short story way too long i was a little disappointed that the film was not that good but i was glad to see that lambert was good and i do not regret staying up until 600am to see it',\n","       'deanna durbin nan grey and barbara read are three smart girls in this

young women now living in switzerland with their divorced mother who hear their father winninger is marrying again not having seen him in 10 years and knowing their mother still loves him they board a ship to america with the help of the housekeeper nanny determined to stop the wedding realizing that the intended called precious barnes is nothing but a gold digger aided and abetted by her mother brady they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy count this is arranged by their father s accountant king the man he chooses is a full time drunk auer but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count milland what a mess this is a delightful film not cloying or overly sugary at all with some nice performances particularly by auer milland barnes and brady the young women are pretty and all do good work the emphasis of course is on young durbin who is a natural actress and a beautifully trained singer in fact her voice as a youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult she has no trouble with the high notes as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice she sings a delightful il bacio in a police station one of the nicest things about the film is to see the father played by charles winninger not want his children around until he sees them and gets to know them barnes as the gold digger isn t all that young but the girls mother looks way up there so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger more glamorous woman in fact he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters universal gives durbin the big star

walter sparrow to come in possession of a mysterious novel that has eerie similarities and connections to his life all based around the number 23 as the story unfolds in real life and fiction sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end the number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution the film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential the screenplay was probably the worst part about it it was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie it seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea he just didn t know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time the second half of the film was running low on ideas the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful joel schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with phone booth and a few other films but the number 23 reminds me that he s still capable of making a stinker he has the movie drenched in style but he just can t get a good focus he moves the film at a clunky and slow pace he switches from reality to what s actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying the actual book in the film that s titled the number 23 is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears when carrey is finally done with book we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery at this point the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension we impatiently wait for the movie to reach it s horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished the acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable jim carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn t even seem to be trying he was either completely over the top in some scenes or just

reason for their murders remains a mystery sy s finest must figure out the staff of the girls dormitory all seem to be hiding something and certain members of the faculty are falling prey to the killer in the red monk robe disguise talented enough to precisely strangle the necks of those attacked with the whip two prisoners are commissioned by a mystery man to use the newly created toxic gas created by a scientist murdered at the beginning of the film during what was supposed to be a monetary exchange for his creation it s a clever scheme where a driver greavesg nter meisnermeets the

top priority for higgins and sir john for it will lead them to the truth they seek in regards to the murders and why they are happening under suspicion are girls dormitory headmistress her author brother a sweaty incredibly nervous chemistry teacher a snooping gardener and the bannister some are red herrings until they are disposed of throwing the viewer for a loop each time until the real mastermind is discovered the ending features multiple twists out of the krimi films i ve seen the college girl murders is the closest to a giallo with it s colorful killer a convoluted plot yielding lots of surprises and potential suspects sordid shenanigans between adults and the college girls at the dormitory i think you can also see the influence of james bond on this particular krimi film

which has latches that cause flaps to darken the windows without revealing the passenger in the back seat and the peep holes used to spy on the girls in their rooms and while swimming many might consider sir john a liability due to his bumbling buffoonish behavior and how he often undermines higgins abilities to get at the truthperhaps poking fun at know it all british inspectors who harm a case more than solve iti felt he was used as comedy relief particularly with his attempts at psychoanalyzing suspects and potential victims often misunderstanding what are told to him higgins using the skills adopted over his years as an investigator instead follows the clues facts often avoiding sir john as much as possible capable direction by the reliable alfred vohrer who keeps the pace humming at a nice speed and the screenplay is full of interesting characters and lurid contentthe fact that so many of the adults surrounding the dormitory are suspect any of them might be the one wielding the whip or calling the shots behind those murdered girls executions i d say this may be one of the bestif not the bestexamples of the krimi genre for it keeps you guessing always one more

m pretty sure they re entirely made up for the movie i ll eat the dust cover of my hardback copy apparently the three main female characters of the novel aren t enough to carry the movie zenia s manipulations aren t interesting unless we see them happen to a man and a man s life is screwed up roz charis and toni tell their stories to a man because it s not important if a man doesn t hear them i liked the characters in the book it hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a man s story i normally do not look for feminist angles on media and i tried to enjoy the movie as is if i hadn t read the book i might have enjoyed the movie a lot more so if you like the cop and the ex cop and you want to read more about them you re out of luck read the novel if you want to enjoy luscious prose

people drift through life moving from one thing or one person to the next without batting an eye others latch on to a cause another person or a principle and remain adamant committed to whatever it is and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it but we re all different made of different clay as one of the characters in this film puts it which is what makes life so interesting some people are just plain crazy though and maybe that s the way you have to be to live among the masses who knows who knows what it takes to make things life work writer director lisa krueger takes a shot at it using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed and how one gets committed and obsession in committed starring heather graham as a young woman who is adamant committed obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy too her name is joline and this is her story admittedly joline has always been a committed person in work relationships in life in general she s a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what and when she marries carl luke wilson it s forever the only problem is someone forgot to tell carl and 597 days into the marriage he s gone off to find himself and figure it all out when joline realizes he s not coming back she refuses to give up on him or their marriage maybe it s because of that clay she s made of regardless she leaves their home in new york city and sets off to find him which she does in el paso texas of all places but once she knows where he is she keeps her distance giving him his space and not even letting him know she s there she considers carl as being in a spiritual coma and it s her job to keep a spiritual vigil over him until he comes to his senses and while she watches and waits her life is anything but dull as she encounters a young woman named carmen patricia velazquez a waitress at one of the local eateries carmen s grampy alfonso arau who is something of a mystic t bo mark ruffalo a truck driver who has issues concerning carl and neil goran visnjic an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy to her for joline it s a journey of discovery during which she learns a lot about carl but even more about herself there s a touch of humor a touch of romance and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot and krueger presents it all extremely well delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining her characters are very real people with all the wants needs and imperfections that make up the human condition a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story we see it from joline s point of view as krueger makes us privy to joline s thoughts and therefore her motivations which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold that along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates makes for a very effective piece of storytelling there s an underlying seriousness to this subject matter but krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that joline encounters and the result is a well textured affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life heather graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make joline a character totally of her own creation she immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person and one that is real and for this film to work it was imperative that joline be viable and believable and graham succeeds on all fronts her screen presence has never been more alluring and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes is enough to draw you in entirely it s all a part of the character she creates there s an appeal to joline that exudes from her entire countenance who she is inside and out she s a likable agreeable person and because you ve shared her innermost thoughts you know who she is it s a good job all the way around beginning with the way the character was written to the way graham brings her so vibrantly to life as carmen patricia velazquez is totally engaging as well her performance is very natural and straightforward and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character she has a charismatic presence but is less than flamboyant and it gives her an aspect that is attractively down to earth she is refreshingly open and up front you get the impression that carmen is not one to hold anything back but is totally honest on all fronts and that too is part of her appeal and as with joline this character is well written and velazquez brings her convincingly to life overall there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film including those of luke wilson casey affleck as joline s brother jay goran visnjic alfonso arau and especially mark ruffalo as t bo who with very little actual screen time manages to create a memorable character the supporting cast includes kim dickens jenny clea du vall mimi summer phoenix meg art alexakis new york car thief dylan baker carl s editor and mary kay place psychiatrist a film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider the big picture reflecting upon who we are where we re going and what we really need committed is an enjoyable experience a ride

child and his father who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family the story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to more deeply understand the

brought us hiroshima mon amour takes on the challenge of making a 1930s french musical in vibrant colour the opening voice over with old embellished inter titles was a nice touch then the camera aperture opens like the old hand crankers on a black white placard the camera backs off or rather up suddenly showing us the surprisingly brilliant colours of an elegant table set for a tea party this is all in the first 60 seconds then the music starts a rather banal and forgettable diddy featuring an unconvincing chorus of 3 girls blabbering some nonsense which has no relevance to the film and yes i speak french so i can t blame it on the subtitles those characters whiz out the door and are replaced by more people who break into an even more forgettable song then they leave and finally audrey tautou appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue 15 minutes into the film i m not sure what resnais intended by starting off with such a yawning waste of time musical cacophony but the effect on the viewer is to make you want to hurl skittles at the screen and storm out i endured it didn t get much better i ll tell you why there is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters we don t even see their faces half the time as resnais seems too intent on showing off the expensive scenery to care about the actual people in front of the camera people flit on off stage like moths around a lamp and we the audience are unable to focus on any particular person or plot it s as if you were to take every episode of the brady bunch and cram it into a 2 hour movie with bad

family were bored out of our wits the singing just kept coming one after the other i mean seriously just one more music number and it would have broke even with rent furthermore i noticed hardly any character development in any of the characters i just didn t care what happened to them even when eddie murphy s character died of a drug overdose i knew i should have been sad but i just couldn t feel any emotion for that character the characters were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and whatnot but there personalities were not revealed enough to draw me in finally the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care which goes along with the lack of character development this movie reminded me of a copy cat movie based on ray chicago and rent ray and chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion overall i think this movie would best suit someone who doesn t really care about an overall story yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun

just about to take her board exam and realize her dream meanwhile julia s sister and brother in law are murdered and as the nearest living relative she is compelled to take in her niece amanda arlen aguayo stewart to avoid having her become a ward of the state amanda is about 7 years old from her appearance amanda is so traumatized from her parent s murder that she has become mute needless to say julia s 16 hour days get longer caring for amanda rob lowe plays kevin finney a charming neighbor man in their apartment building who works his way into the lives of julia and amanda he is always there with a trick or a joke to help amanda deal with her distress amanda really starts to warm up to kevin as the film progresses perhaps more than to her aunt julia starts to rely on kevin to take some of the load of caring for amanda as she attempts to handle her case load and prepare for her board examination kevin is always there whenever some crisis erupts for julia the chemistry between rob and catherine mary was great you keep watching to see them get together before the end of the film the chemistry between rob and arlen was good as well arlen managed to convey quite a lot without the benefit of words the plot had julia and amanda gradually warming up to each other you can see them working out a relationship as the film progresses we discover that julia s sister and brother in law the meyers were involved in industrial espionage they stole an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer they had three associates who intended to share the proceeds of the theft julia discovers that the meyers were planning to skip the country under assumed identities the plot is unclear whether the meyers intended to double cross their associates or were themselves double crossed in any case the meyers are murdered in their home by 2 of their former associates the killers make no attempt to extract the location of the microchip from the meyers before killing them the killers search the home and fail to find their prize they leave a living witness to their crime amanda the killers then spend the remainder of the film making clumsy attempts to extract the microchip from julia and amanda who have no idea where the prize is located eventually the killers kidnap amanda in hopes she knows something about the microchip s location eventually julia discovers the truth about kevin he is an investigator hired to recover the stolen microchip after some rough moments in the relationship they manage to rescue amanda and dispatch the bad guys the predictable ending has the three forming a family and moving happily into a future together what struck me about the plot were major holes kevin moves into the same apartment building as julia and amanda the day after the murder of the meyers how does he know that the microchip is not already in the hands of the killers the killers blithely leave fingerprints at the murder scene with no concern for concealing their identity the killer that pretends to be a psychiatrist is revealed to amanda by the remnants of red paint from the murder scene on his shoe soles he was not shown in the murder scene at the start of the film there are other weaknesses along these lines too numerous to mention the film could have been a lot better if the script had been refined more before filming filling in the plot holes would

widower with a son by each marriage and any woman who got involved with adam hoss and little joe were going to end up dying because we couldn t get rid of the formula of the widower and the three sons that started this classic tv western perhaps if bonanza were being done today the writers would have had revolving women characters who came in and out of the lives of the cartwrights people have relationships some go good some not so good it s just life and we re less demanding of our heroes today so if a relationship with one of them goes south we don t have to kill the character off to keep the survivor s nobility intact but that s if bonanza were done today but we were still expecting a lot from our western heroes and bonanza though it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from nbc certainly helped the secret of bonanza s success was the noble patriarch ben cartwright and his stalwart sons ben cartwright was the ideal tv dad in any genre you want to name his whole life was spent in the hard work of building that immense ponderosa spread for his three children the kids were all different in personality but all came together in a pinch the cartwrights became and still are an american institution i daresay more people cared about this family than the kennedys just the popularity that bonanza has in syndication testifies to that pernell roberts as oldest son adam was written out of the show rumor has it he didn t care for the noble cartwright characters which he felt bordered on sanctimonious perhaps if it were done now he d have liked it better in the way i describe this was just the beginning for michael landon how many people get three hit tv shows to their credit landon also has highway to heaven and little house on the prarie where he had creative control little joe was the youngest most hot headed but the most romantic of the cartwrights when roberts left the show kept going with the two younger sons but when big dan blocker left the heart went out of bonanza other characters had been added on by that time david canary tim matheson and ben cartwright adopted young mitch vogel but big loyal but a little thick hoss was easily the most lovable of the cartwrights his sudden demise after surgery left too big a hole in that family so the cartwrights of the ponderosa have passed into history i got a real taste of how america took the cartwrights to heart when i visited the real virginia city it doesn t look anything like what you see in bonanza but near lake tahoe just about where you see the ponderosa on the map at the

at the very worst an act of murder like most people when the siege at waco was occurring i assumed that david koresh was a completely evil madman who was leading a violent cult after seeing this i think that koresh was more likely a slightly unbalanced and confused guy who inadvertently caught the attention of the us government through his eccentric actions sure there were lots of weapons at the branch davidian compound but none of it was illegal it was absolutely heartbreaking to see the video footage of the people inside the compound all of them seeming to be very nice and harmless and

hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they re taking their bows and courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer employer is really the wrong term to use though for although technically their relationship is that of employer and employee most of the time sir and norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple yes there are others in the cast of this movie but there is no question that the true stars are finney courtenay and the marvelous script by ronald harwood that is not to say that there aren t other fine performances most notably eileen atkins as the long suffering stage manager madge there is a wonderful scene where sir and madge talk about old desires old regrets and what might have been although it doesn t get talked about these days it is worth remembering that the dresser was nominated for five academy awards best actor nominations for both finney and courtenay best picture best director peter yates and best adapted screenplay i had remembered this as being a good movie but i wasn t prepared to be as completely mesmerized as i was from beginning to end if you want to see an example of what great acting is all about and be hugely entertained all the while then i encourage you to see the dresser',\n","       'i liked boyle s performance but that s about the only positive thing i can say everything was overdone to the point of absurdity most of the actors spoke like you would expect your 9 year old nephew to speak if he were pretending to be a jaded stone hearted cop or an ultra evil villain the raspy voice overs seemed amateurish to me i could go buy a cheap synthesizer and crank out better opening music and what s with the whole 1984ish police torture stuff it was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story cox added a lot of things in fact that he apparently thought would be really cool but had nothing to do with the story that s a big disappointment because one of the things that makes borges stories so good is his minimalism they are tightly bound with no superfluous details this movie is just the opposite i stopped watching after the scene where lonnrot is questioning the guy from the yidische zaitung or thereabouts i wasted 4 renting this but at least i can get some satisfaction from writing this review and hopefully saving others from making the same mistake',\n","       'hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world it only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap re invented over and over again take superheroes for example for each x man and spiderman there are daredevil elektra ghost rider and hulk japanese horror remakes are even worst it only took the ring which was pitch perfect mostly because of mr gore verbinsky to bring a ton of look alike creepy woman based horrors eg the ring 2 the eye dark water which was fine but pointless and the grudges the first grudge wasn t entirely bad it was scary most of the way which is what one could expect from it plus the plot had some brains mixing narratives grudge 2 is exactly like the previous this could be a good thing but hey what boy men in black ii was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain for the grudge 2 the critic goes the same way tired scares bad acting except for amber tamblyn and clich s all over the place three stories take place on different places and time there is aubrey tamblyn investigating what drove her sister karen sarah michelle gellar to death allison arielle kebbel who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place and finally an american family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door glad to say and i mean it that everything is tied up at the end but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture when everything else is simply tiresome and dull the chills are all over there a girl alone in the lockers someone who shouldn t enter a house others that dig too deep meanwhile ghosts keep killing and killing and killing which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the ebola epidemic hey doesn t that seem just like another bad japanese remake something called pulse yeah day after day it s getting easier to hold a grudge against hollywood bullshits',\n","       'this is an excellent film about the characters in a adult swimming class their problems relationships and interactions with each other it should have managed a wider distribution as it s much better than similar films from major studios out at the same time the swimming instructor is an almost olympian reduced to teaching adults basic lessons and often the target of horndogging from his female students he attempts more or less to fend them off with varying results the students characters are mainstream usa teachers policemen college students and retired people all of whom haven t learned to swim for some reason the movie covers their relationships including friends relatives and romantic conquests as they go through the class several subplots provide amusing fodder including a teacher going through a divorce some high school students making a documentary and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys this is a good date

  'despite having an absolutely horrid script more about that later this film is still vaguely watchable just because it stars two excellent actors barbara stanwyck and henry fonda aside from one or two real stinkers i d probably watch just about anything with them in the film as i am a huge fan of hollywood s golden age of the 1930s and 40s however no matter how much i love their films i just can t recommend this film the movie begins with fonda and stanwyck on vacation at some ski resort the two haven t yet met but the film begins loudly and obnoxiously with a scene in which fonda horribly yodels while skiing it was done so unsubtly and made my teeth grind but i stuck it out especially when fonda fell into a snow bank and this stopped the yodeling in hindsight perhaps i should have just turned it off then fonda is knocked out in the fall and barbara goes for help back at the ski lodge he seems okay but fortunately she is also a doctor and has him x rayed and nurses him back to health he in turn becomes infatuated with her and proposes to her despite hardly knowing each other they marry and so far the film seems like a sweet but very slight romantic comedy once home however all isn t rosy as she jumps right back into her job as a family doctor and he begins exhibiting signs that he is a controlling and potentially dangerous man due to his jealousy the film plays it all for laughs but frankly fonda s behaviors were really creepy spying on her and her male patients attacking or threatening any man she treats tripping a patient who already has a back injury and stomping into a surprise party and insisting that everyone there men and women are out to steal away his wife he comes off as a combination of a sociopath and paranoid schizophrenic but it s all supposed to be for laughs considering that he seems like a dangerous nut you would think that stanwyck would file for an annulment along with a restraining order but oddly she gets mad but just can t stay mad at fonda because he s so i can t think of the right word creepy is all that comes to mind later out of the blue multi millionaire fonda gets a job working the counter at a department store then through magical thinking he and babs seem to assume his hostility and violent jealousy is all a thing of the past so a job apparently cures anger and suspicions when this job falls through the film ends with fonda buying his own hospital giving barbara a job there and they live happily ever after they don t go any further with the story but i assume based on fonda s character that he then spent most of his time as hospital administrator beating up all the male patients the first portion at the ski lodge and the next did not fit well together nor did the final horatio alger inspired section where the rich boy made good in the business world they were like three separate plots but despite this the most serious problem with the film was its seeming to excuse away domestic violence and delusional jealousy what a creepy little film thank goodness neither fonda nor stanwyck are known for this yechy film but for all their other lovely films',\n","       'the story is very trustworthy and powerful the technical side of the movie is quite fine even the directing of it the main problem is with the castings that turned that movie into almost another local and regular clich with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression beside the small role of the father rafael played impressively by asi dayan all other actors were unfortunately not in their best the role of the elder blind girl played by taly sharon was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile there were moments and

cama de gato was the worst brazilian movie of the decade i watched it giving it a chance after all first time director producer writer alexandre stockler managed to make his debut feature shot in video for just us 4000 and though it looks even cheaper i can t begin to imagine all he went through to finally get it exhibited in theaters with no big sponsors or production companies behind it then as i watched it i realized why but whatever chances you re ready to give to cama de gato they shrink to zero within 10 minutes it s an unbelievably preposterous verbose ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray brazilian upper middle class youth as a bunch of spoiled neo nazis hooked on bad sex drugs and violence and they re made to look like closeted gays too made with no visible trace of talent imagination expertise or notion of structure visually and aurally it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on youtube only here it lasts ninety two count em minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness and it s not even funny bad we ve all seen the story before bored young guys want to have fun go partying take drugs and everything goes wrong there s gang rape spanking murder the accidental death falling down the staircase of the mother of one of the boys culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill moral and literal garbage get it the film is heavily influenced by larry clark especially kids and bully but clark s films though also moralist and sexploitative are high class masterworks compared to this crap i don t think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audience s throat stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his non stop moralist rant into our brains by repetition and exhaustion you do get numb minded with so much babbling yelling inept direction shaky camera and terrible acting going on stockler doesn t care a bit about technique the quality of the images framing sound recording soundtrack songs dialog sets editing etc is uniformly appalling but he s a narcissistic control freak he anticipates the criticisms he s bound to get by adding subtitles with smartie cutie comments and by making the protagonists comment at one point how far fetched and phony it all is i could relate to that despite his megalomaniac ambitions stockler seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure he can t even decide if he wants gritty realism hand held video camera etc or stylization repetition of scenes use of alternate takes etc damn he can t even decide where to put his camera there s use of subjective camera for the three leads the dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever the plot exists simply to justify the director s profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for all you see is a filmmaker being hateful preachy condemning moralizing without the benefit of a minimum of talent or technique to go with it it s very disappointing to find caio blat in this mess certainly one of the most promising young film actors in brazil with his sleepy eyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall sal mineo s blat can be highly effective under good direction as in carandiru lavoura arcaica proibido proibir here he s told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly under equipped actors in recent memory he also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scenes so goddawful they look rather like web cam porn the film opens and ends with real interviews with typical middle class youth stockler wants us to take those interviews as proof of what he s trying to preach in fiction but he blatantly despises and makes fun of his interviewees selecting a highlight of abject racist sexist stupid statements which only shows assholes exist everywhere stockler wants to prove that brazilian middle class youths are all present or future fascists because they re middle class and enjoy recreational drugs is he saying all neo fascists are on drugs or that drugs potentialize fascist behavior i couldn t tell with its dogmatic self righteousness headache inducing technique and mind bending boredom cama de gato is bad for a 1000 reasons but above all it s harmful in a very insidious manner it gives detractors of brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument cama de gato is best unwatched unmentioned buried and forgotten',\n","       'goldeneye will always go down as one of thee most

at the cinema in principle the acting the sets and the music were excellent and are the main reason why i m rating this a 4 in this version sara is a little too self sacrificing for my taste there is no way she would have deliberately lied to miss minchin just to stop her punishing the other girls in the book she makes a point of describing lies as not just wicked but vulgar there s also far too much of a disneyfied ending for me sara s father coming back from the dead and all of them trotting off into the indian sunset while the book does have a happy and critics might say equally improbable ending it doesn t leave you thinking oh puh leeze about the only things true to the book were 1 sara s father being a soldier 2 the lines between sara and her father are you learning me by heart no i know you by heart you are inside my heart 3 sara s friendship with becky and her adopting lottie although this last one wasn t developed as much as it could have been 4 the changing of her room by adding various luxury items that part was brilliantly done 5 the basic core a rich girl being flung into poverty suddenly is there but that s about all that is people might say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience possibly all i can say to that is i have two cousins aged 7 and 12 respectively who were big fans of this film until they read the book if all you want is a feel good family film then this delivers if you re looking for a film that actually tells the story of a little princess in fact if you ve read the book don t waste time with this one it s such a shame with a cast like this if they d stuck to at least the basic story it could have been fantastic am i harping on about read the book this and read the book that a little too much very probably but if someone attempts to adapt a book especially such a classic into a movie then they should at least have done the same thing preferably more than once',\n","       'this is just one more of those hideous films

year old girl would you have made a picture sympathizing and empathizing with this person answer hell no imagine switching the genders in this film and then you ll see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of garbage were the genders switched there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal instead we d likely be treated to a portrayal of a monstrous and hideous man preying upon a young girl his lascivious behavior landing him in prison and his brainwashed victim suffering from stockholm syndrome the only reason letourneau does not receive the same treatment

action adventure and romance and one of the premiere casting match ups of the era with errol flynn and olivia de havilland in the lead roles as evident on this board the picture doesn t pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling to get beyond that one need only put aside the history book and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction i know i know that s hard to do when you consider custer s last stand at the little big horn and it s prominence in the history of post civil war america so i guess there s an unresolved quandary with the picture no matter how you look at it there s a lot to take in here though for the picture s two hour plus run time custer s arrival at west point is probably the first head scratcher riding up as he does in full military regalia the practical joke by sharp arthur kennedy putting him up in the major s headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble ironically a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy as in custer s first meeting with libby bacon and subsequent encounters that include tea reader callie hattie mcdaniel i hadn t noticed it before in other films but mcdaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the forties mantan moreland so much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been moreland hamming it up in a dress with that in mind the owl scene was a hoot too as for flynn it s interesting to note that a year earlier he portrayed jeb stuart opposite ronald reagan s depiction of general custer in santa fe trail both vying for the attention of none other than olivia de havilland in that film reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of custer that history remembers while in flynn s portrayal here it s more than evident but it doesn t come close to that of richard mulligan s take on the military hero in 1970 s little big man let s just say that one was a bit over the top the better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture that and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival sharp just before riding into the little big horn in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on one s point of view earlier a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into custer s character when he stated you take glory with you when it s your time to go',\n","       'i was looking forward to the guardian but when i walked into the theater i wasn t really in the mood for it at that particular time it s kind of like the olive garden i like it but i have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it i m not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit the trailers looked good but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last kevin costner movie that dealt with the subject waterworld plus despite the promise ashton kutcher showed in the butterfly effect i m still not completely sold on him something about the guy just annoys me probably has to do with his simian features it took approximately two minutes for my fears to subside and for my hesitancies to slip away the movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission and i was gripped tighter than kenny rogers orange face lift my concerns briefly bristled at kutcher s initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously cool and rebellious sunglasses a tough guy toothpick in his mouth and sportin a smirk that d make george clooney proud yeah we get it i was totally ready to hate him but then he had to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jabs darn you ape man efficiently mixing tense exciting rescue scenes drama humor and solid acting the guardian is easily a film that i dare say the majority of audiences will enjoy you can quibble about its clich s predictability and rare moments of overcooked sappiness but none of that takes away from the entertainment value i had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when costner started training the young guys but on the contrary the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film coast guard rescue swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen so i feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it is to make it is very informative and a great way to introduce audiences to this under appreciated group do you have what it takes to be a rescue swimmer just think about it you get to go on dangerous missions in cold dark rough water and then you must fight disorientation exhaustion hypothermia and a lack of oxygen all while trying to help stranded panicked people who are depending on you for their survival and if all that isn t bad enough sometimes you can t save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who lives and who dies man who wants all that responsibility not me i had no idea what it was really like for these guys and who would have thought i d have an ashton kutcher kevin costner movie to thank for the education not only does the guardian do a great job of paying tribute to this rare breed of hero but lucky for us it also does a good job of entertaining its paying customers the gist moviegoers wanting an inside look at what it s like to embark on a

good performances still this movie does work it forgoes blood and gore there s some but this is pg and manges to work with some very creepy visuals and atmosphere the acting hampers a lot of it but it still works martin especially chews the scenery in his role i can t explain exactly why i sort of like this movie but it did work on me it s a quiet kind of horror that isn t made anymore hardly a

heart she doesn t want to be a complacent wifey despite the maternal way she speaks to her husband over the phone she meets two men on her journey a former college football hero who after an accident during a game has been left with permanent brain damage and a sexy strutting motorcycle cop who has a great deal of trouble in his own life the clear clean landscapes as photographed by the very talented wilmer butler are astutely realized as are the characters shirley knight james caan and robert duvall each deliver strong gripping performances most especially since these are not very likable people in conventional terms some scenes such as knight s first call home from a pay phone or her first night alone with caan where they play simon says are almost too intimate to watch coppola toys with reality turning the jagged memories of his characters into scrapbooks we ve been made privy to he allows scenes to play out yet the editing is quite nimble and the film is never allowed to get too heavy there are at least two or three very frisky moments it s a heady endeavor so much so that the picture was still being shown at festivals nearly five years later some may shun

movie takes place primarily between two characters as they travel 3000 miles or so from france to saudi arabia going through most of europe italy bulgaria croatia slovenia turkey before arriving in the middle east but this is not a tour and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sights reda s father is in his twilight years and wishes to do the haj however since walking and taking the mule is out of the question he chooses to travel to mecca by car he can t drive and therefore enlists the help of reda to his son s protest to get him there in their broken down vehicle but reda doesn t see the point of having him go along when his dad could opt for the plane he resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldn t understand and hence we set off in this arduous journey with father and son being not the best of pals the beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair the challenges they face the weird people they meet having to duke it out in varied weather conditions and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car we see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other the father trying to impose on his son and the son trying to assert himself as an adult but circumstances we see reveal that reda is quite a fish out of water through the many encounters they actually team up quite well despite their differences it s perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with hari raya haji and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their haj the final scene in mecca is truly a sight to behold and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear as reda tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people congregating the sights of europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destination it certainly rang home the thought of

title in amazing shining white and blue stating the thing one of the best opening credits for a horror film ever the cast of actors who play the twelve man science team are a joy to behold and the

excellent as macready the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men trying to combat a lethal shape changing monstrosity that has infiltrated their base all the actors in this are really good and create terrific scenes of paranoia and tension as to who the thing has infected my favourite scene in the whole film has to be when macready tests everyone thats still alive for infection it is tense scary and finally spectacular i love it because its funny as well special mention must go to rob bottin for his truly amazing make up effects and shape changing designs of the alien itself if he didn t get an oscar for best visual effects at the time then he damn well should have this is also debatable as to whether this is john carpenter s greatest filmits certainly a

this show is utter crap everything s wrong with it everything getting past just the lousy animation and design the stories are ridiculously convoluted and with no character development or apparent interest by the writers of this dreck to give any substance to any stories and for god s sakeis it just me or is the joker in every episode is gotham that much of a revolving door justice system or

lives blissfully and peacefully one day they get a letter from the general a man who has made it his mission in life to avenge his daughters death he makes claims of supernatural powers being at work and explains that he will visit them soon meanwhile a chance encounter with a strange woman results in the lafontaines looking after her daughter carmilla for several months soon laura starts to be overwhelmed by strange dreams and begins to come down with a strange illness who is this mysterious carmilla and just what has she to do with laura s condition and the general i have invented this game and would like as many people as possible to play it and let me know what their results are i even have a catchy name and would have a jingle too but i can t be bothered with that it s called the this movie doesn t make any sense game all you have to do is whilst watching the movie try to come up with a complete plot that explains what is happening i mean complete all questions answered everything makes sense absolutely complete it will have to answer such questions as why can vampires walk around in day light why are they all lesbians why is a girl called bob and why does she shoot herself when is the movie a dream and when is it real why does killing zombies appear to be an accepted part of life that doesn t make anyone bat an eyelid why does travis fontaine spot and run down a zombie without slowing down whilst driving his car yet when faced with a woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car accept the excuse that she is a zombie too and why does he then let a girl which he later openly reveals that he knows is the head vampire drive with him in his car and then let her drive off alone with his daughter in a stolen car what the hell is the asylum scene all about what the hell is the green goo all about why does the head vampire suddenly start dressing like a nurse why are there never any vampires fighting zombies what is the significance of the necklace what is it made of why does it kill vampires and how does jenna know that in fact sod it it s just as much fun trying to come up with as many questions about this movie too i have my plot and i have to admit it is not quite there but it is a pretty good effort in conclusion vampires vs zombies has no moment in it where there are actually vampires fighting zombies everyone in the movie seems to know

this is supposed to be funny it said comedy on the dvd case after all and it goes on like that had i seen this in a movie theater i probably would have heard part of the audience roar with laughter because it is so funny and because they are supposed to sit in a comedy while it is fascinating to think about what it is funny and what isn t this movie unfortunately only delivers arguments about what isn t brilliant brains can make anything funny people like ernst lubitsch billy wilder or mel brooks have proved that fact but you have to know the mechanics i suppose director and co scriptwriter dani levy does not bother about those mechanics he thinks that certain things simply are funny the fact that two orderlies are gay and kiss over a man in a coma for example do not get me wrong some people can make that funny dani levy can t not for me anyway the main problem i have with this movie is that i can t see a reason behind the way the main characters behave i could not understand why the two brothers one an orthodox jew from west germany one a third class carbon copy of fast eddie felson from former east germany so strongly disliked each other they are both rather bland characters their children are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other well one is a lesbian now but raises the daughter she has with her cousin but even these incestuous relationships if anything they are embarrassing just come through as an excuse because the scriptwriters could not come up with anything better the acting is not bad udo semel i actually came to like quite a lot although he reminded me more of ex chancellor helmut kohl a lighter version than of a venerable orthodox jew the direction in itself is not really bad either but maybe levy

clean up other than that it s a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations i d like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the zucker movies where you don t get all

faults it s audio is muddy and video had some quirks the characters aren t deep at all and the overall plot isn t altogether solid the plot is lacking something that i can t put my finger on it just seems a little fluffy but if you love sci fi and are interested in what hg wells though might happened in the next hundred years this is a must see it s worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was

script himself and on top of all that it has pam grier how could it fail there may be spoilers within first of all it was dumbed down much of the horror from the book was lost as bradbury must have been forced to keep the violence to a minimum all the visuals from the bookgone everything that made you squirmgone and then there s the acting like a lot of movies that disney threw out in the 80s the kids in this movie cannot act and this bugged me a lot neither of them looked 13 but 9 or 10 their strong friendship wasn t addressed it was more like they were acquaintaces you d think jason robards and jonathan pryce could pull this off in their roles of mr halloway and mr dark but here it s like they just don t care all they want to do is somehow pay off some mortgage or something this is far from being some of their best performances pam grier was fine as the witch but the charecter of the dust witch herself wasn t well pulled off she s a lot less evil and doesn t have the presence as she did in the book and everything that was left out of the book the ballon night chase the marking of jim s house the real death of mr dark what happened to mr coogan on the merry go round the fate of the lightening rod salesman the real death of the witch and oh so much more and the special effects were bad even for the 80s the merry go round of doom for one thing with the superimposed horses going around wasn t really creepy and that weird green mist that really had nothing to do with anything i could keep going about how this movie ripped apart the original novel but it makes

through my tv guide and happened to see this film it didn t much details except something like john lennon and paul mccartney meet after the beatles have broken up jared harris stars i d never heard of him he played john or aiden quinn who played paul however they are certainly underestimated actors the film had a slow start but as it developed i could see how well quinn but especially harris played their characters as a huge fan i sort of know what the real lennon and mccartney are like the script was brilliant and harris got lennon s accent personality and mannerisms spot on quinn played mccartney quite well but sometimes went into his irish accent the make up artists made them look excellent this paragraph may be counted as a spoiler as i mentioned before it got off to a slow start but soon developed and became quite an emotional film i found the bit in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both of the musicians as for lennon s rude line in the italian restaurant totally unnecessary the ending was very poignant and brings a tear to my eye whenever i watch it it is quite different from the other biographical films i ve seen where it s about how the beatles got together and became famous and those never really did the characters that well eg backbeat in conclusion i would say if you re a beatles or john lennon or paul mccartney fan give it a chance you may have pleasent surprise at only about 95 minutes long it s worth waiting for the film to develop if anyone does know whether the meeting of 1976 really did happen please send it to the

has done so he expects larry to return the favor and kill his mother the resulting action is often quite funny and even poignant it s certainly never dull and often full of surprises the acting is exceptional even if ramsey was a bit over the top crystal is as good as he can be and devito has always been undervalued as a performer the film relies on quite a bit of physical comedy which usually works often painfully so the film makes use of some truly innovative editing techniques in some scenes and the off beat tone is truly refreshing i have often been critical of the late 1980s as being a time of artistic malaise and down right lazy film making throw momma from the train takes chances both in how its characters are drawn as well as its general plot how many comedies revolve around a son having his mother murdered the film isn t too long and it is chock full of laughs writers are apt to find it more interesting than the general public but it can still be enjoyed by just about

same time a place he can t leave because the moment he does he knows he ll be arrested boyer s performance was good and i can understand why he was nominated for an oscar he captures the essence of such a character a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time the movie itself unfortunately was quite a letdown a number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent of which i ll mention two first was the idea that the police wouldn t enter the casbah that was stated pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander and yet repeated references in the movie suggest that in fact the police did enter the casbah fairly regularly so neither the suggestion by commissioner janvier that the police wouldn t enter nor the statement by inspector slimane also a decent performance by joseph calleia that they could get into the casbah but not out seemed to make much sense i also found it difficult to believe that le moko hardened criminal mastermind that he was could be so quickly swept off his feet by gaby hedy lamarr to the point where he entertains the local populace by singing love songs and then leaves the casbah to find her essentially giving himself up i understand the irony of the final few scenes of course as pepe leaves the freedom of his prison the casbah only to find real freedom in his capture because he s shot and killed by the police i just found it impossible to believe that someone like le moko would fall into such a trap this is worth watching for boyer and to a lesser extent calleia but the story is disappointing

imbecile much as bob denver did neither really seemed to be able to break out to other types of roles assuming they were simply typecast it was probably because of the slouch the wild stare and the high pitched voice john ritter whom knotts worked with in three s company was able to transcend his genre branching out successfully into dramatic roles like the dreamer of oz but the closest knotts ever got was a small role in pleasantville even leslie nielsen was a bad fit here uncomfortably neither straight dramatic actor as he was at the time nor deadpan comedic actor as he later became in

disappointed first scene was ok but the whole rest of the movie in shaky hands camera mode is really annoying i guess the main reason for making such a movie and nominating it for oscar is this american military machine people who makes money on war urgently need an excuse or justification of war in iraq by bungling up something sort of patriotic why these heroic efforts of director and the main character to inspire the audience with an idea of loving war like a drug oh please come on what a bore watch this to get an idea of how low the movie academy can fall',\n","       'this movie

the edge of your seat',\n","       'don t torture a duckling is one of fulci s earlier and honestly in terms of story line better films and although not the typical bloodbath that fulci is known for this is still a very unique and enjoyable film the story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders are occurring some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations either as suspects or those helping the investigation or in some cases both include the towns police force a small time reporter a beautiful and rich ex drug addict a young priest and his mother an old man who practices witchcraft and his female prot g a mentally handicapped townsman and a deaf mute little girl all of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns until the actual killer is revealed don t torture a duckling is neither a classical giallo or a typical fulci gore film although it does contain elements of both it is more of an old fashioned murder mystery with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence although nothing nearly as strong as some of fulci s later works this is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end recommended for giallo murder mystery fans or anyone looking to check out some of fulci s non splatter films but don t despair don t torture still has more than it s fair share of violence and sleaze some may be put off by the subject of the child killings and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys which is also kind of disconcerting but if that type of material doesn t bother you then definitely give this one a look 85 10',\n","       'i am not so old that i can t remember laughing at bobcat goldthwait a couple times but some where in

anything remotely funny after hearing the opening line goldthwait obviously hates himself so much that he needs to degrade in order to feel better even if it is his own imaginary characters he degrades if you ever saw shakes the clown you know how unfunny bobcat was 15 years agothis movie is worse it was not even funny by accident it is sad pathetic and a total waste of time may goldthwaits

of the damned and is probably better for your health it isn t that this movie is necessarily bad for your health but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie you can count the number of pages by anne rice that i ve read on one hand but after seeing this movie and interview with a vampire i get the feeling that she writes really good novels the plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history still stuart townsend s voice over narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than brad pitt s vampire narrative ever did and you can tell that queen of the damned s limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the anne rice storyline while interview decided to go with lace and elegance queen relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously one can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places the costumes and rock roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack however i ll give credit where credit is due the soundtrack is excellent korn and disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like butthead the film opens with a very cool goth rock zoom splice montage but after the first ten minutes or so the directing degenerates quickly it s as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasn t enough time and enough money to do an anne rice novel justice what results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects unfortunately queen of the damned fails to do the genre justice just as its john carpenter counterparts fail to impress where are the yellow contacts where s the pale blue make up scene after scene i shook my head reminiscing about the days of salem s lot and fright night when low budget was done right there are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage props to aaliyah and may her soul forever rest in peace she might have become a renowned actress had her life not been taken from us so prematurely for she did give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing did i mention that the soundtrack was good let s see what else can i say it wasn t too long the anne rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like francis ford coppola got his hands on it there are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot but all in all it was a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of second rate vampire movies out there the director of this movie went on to direct a new battlestar galactica mini series if that tells you anything jy jimboduck dot com',\n","       'this film

to use far cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished people who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned that this is not far cry this is something mr boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks feeling loneley on the set mr boll invites three of his countrymen to play with these players go by the names of til schweiger udo kier and ralf moeller three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz so the tale goes like this jack carver played by til schweiger yes carver is german all hail the bratwurst eating dudes however i find that tils acting in this movie is pretty badass people have complained about how he s not really staying true to the whole carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we don t really know what he looked like when he was kicking a however the storyline in this film is beyond demented we see the evil mad scientist dr krieger played by udo kier making genetically mutated soldiers or gms as they are called performing his top secret research on an island that reminds me of spoiler vancouver for some reason thats right no palm trees here instead we got some nice rich lumberjack woods we haven t even gone far before i started to cry mehehe i cannot go on any more if you wanna stay true to bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true boll experience meaning most of it will suck there are some things worth mentioning that would imply that boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes until the whole cromed albino gms squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh the movie far cry reeks

mini skirt on the back and because there was a restricted viewing sticker on it i thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge i was 100 wrong having watched it i have to wonder how it got the restricted sticker since there is hardly any foul language little violence and the closest thing to nudity honestly i don t usually go around hoping for it is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties you see her panties a lot in this movie because no matter what she s wearing a miniskirt of some sort even the anti religious humor is tame and lame caricatured insincere derivative unoriginal and worst of all not funny in the slightest it would be better just to listen to ray stevens would jesus wear a rolex on his television show this would barely qualify as pg 13 it is not rated but blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of 17 rent this as if it was pornographic any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of requiem for a dream but they insist that zack and reba is worse it is but not in that way in a way this worries me the only thing left that could offend people is the idea of the suicide at the beginning if anybody needs to see movies with honestly portrayed suicides not this one but better ones like the virgin suicides it s teenagers if both of those movies were rated r purely because of the suicide aspect then i have little chance of turning a story i ve been writing into a pg 13 movie the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death in teenagers i think it s number 2 so chances are that most teens have been or will be affected by it just say no to this movie though 2 10',\n","       'this movie was

that would be jack which i ve been meaning to review gut like a fish adults won t learn anything surprising well if you must fast forward to just before the end credits for a educational bit about an

at an art school but i degress i have no idea what the heck kids could possibly get out of this movie most likely it will only upset them we get to watch the moment when russ was traumatized at eight years old there s a better movie kiki s delivery service that has essentially the same message but handles it litely instead of drilling it into your head and the adults will like it too by the way

prophetic masterpiece for all of my life i m now 37 but never having read the book i am totally confused as to what i ve just seen i am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel as i m sure most are but only through hearsay and quotes without this limited knowledge this film would have been a complete mystery and even with it i m still no more educated about the story of 1984 than i was before i watched it on the plus side the cinematography is amazing hurt burton deliver fine performances and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate the prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film making now for the down sides and there are plenty there is a war going on at least as far as the propaganda is concerned but why with who nothing is explained there are a couple of names bandied about eurasia etc but they mean nothing without explanation who is winston what does he do where does he come from where does he work why is he changing news reports why isn t he on the front line why doesn t he eat the food in the canteen what is that drink he s drinking through the entire film why is he so weak ill why isn t he brainwashed like the rest of them what s the deal with his mother sister what happened to his father a little back story would have been nice no scrub that essential for those like myself that haven t read the book without it this is just a confusing and hard to follow art house movie that constantly keeps you guessing at what is actually going on the soundtrack was dis jointed and badly edited and the constant chatter from the big brother screens swamps the dialogue in places making it even harder to work out whats going on i accept that this may have been an artistic choice but it s very annoying all the same also i know this has been mentioned before but why all the nudity it just seemed totally gratuitous and felt like it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of any plot coverage i personally can t abide the way hollywood feels it has to explain story lines word for word these days we are not all brainwashed simpletons but this is a few steps too far the other way i can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that you ve read the book because if this film really is the literal translation that i ve seen many people say i would find it very hard to understand why 1984 is hailed as the classic it is there s no denying that it was light years ahead of it s time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date maybe this has been a sort of bible to the powers that be but many sci fi novelists have done the same without leaving gaping holes in the storyline i guess i have to do what i should have done from the start and buy a copy of the book if i m to make any sense out of

  'it doesn t happen very often but occasionally one man can make a difference a big difference george crile s 2003 best seller charlie wilson s war is a fascinating and eye opening account of the most unlikely difference maker imaginable a relatively obscure congressman from the second district of texas good time charlie was known more for his libertine lifestyle than his libertarian legislation likable and licentious even for a politician charlie wilson served his constituency well since the good folks of lufkin only really wanted two things their guns and to be left alone it s easy street replete with his bevy of beltway beauties known appropriately enough as charlie s angels when asked why his entire office staff was composed of attractive young aides his response is a classic you can teach em to type but you can t teach em to grow tits no argument there but even the most rakish rapscallion has a conscience lurking somewhere underneath and for charlie wilson the unimaginable atrocities being committed in afghanistan moved him to muster his entire political savvy toward funding the utter humiliating defeat of the russian military and possibly to even help hasten the end of the cold war as a result fat chance huh under the skillful direction of mike nichols and a smart snappy screenplay by adam sorkin charlie wilson s war is a sparkling sophisticated satire that chronicles the behind the scene machinations of three colorful characters comprising charlie s team the on screen team is composed of three marvelous actors with four 4 academy awards and nine 9 nominations between them charlie is beautifully portrayed by tom hanks in a solid slightly understated fashion that is among his best work in years he s aided abetted and abedded by joanne herring a wealthy houston socialite played by the still slinky julia roberts hey why else have the bikini scene than to let the world know this by all accounts ms roberts looks good and holds her own but the screenplay never gives us even a hint why kabul and country is so important to her character maybe the two afghan hounds usually by her side know but we as an audience never do as for the third member of the team philip seymour hoffman steals every scene he appears in as gust aurakotos a smart street wise ie non ivy league graduate cia malcontent who knows the score both in the agency s boardroom and in wilson s bedroom for the mujahideen to succeed the most important assistance the us can provide is the ability to shoot down the dreaded mi 21 helicopter gunships which rule the skies this takes money lots of money and eventually charlie s team covertly coerces those in congress to fund the effort to the tune of 1 billion dollars for advanced weaponry to arm the afghan rebels this includes top of the line state of the art anti aircraft and anti tank rockets as well as other highly sophisticated killing devices nasty nasty stuff that this kind of multi billion dollar illicit activity can and does take place behind congressional doors is truly alarming every american should see this movie or read this book because it reveals a truly frightening aspect of the business as usual political scene rarely seen outside the walls of our very own government oh momma i wish it weren t so even though the initial outcome for team charlie was an unqualified success the unimaginable unanticipated final result is that these sophisticated weapons are now used against our troops by the taliban and others since the funding was entirely covert the young generation in this part of the world has no idea the fall of soviet oppression and the end to russian barbarity was the direct result of american intervention yes once the russkies left so did our aid zip for schools zip for infrastructure zip on maintaining meaningful relationships with the afghan people as a result the overall consequence is an unmitigated disaster it s like the forerunner to mission accomplished as nichol s film so pointedly points out the ball you ve set in motion can keep bouncing even after you ve lost interest in it mike krzyzewski knows this eva longoria parker knows this little lateesha in lafayette knows this but the typical american politician doesn t so we go from good guys to bad guys because we couldn t let the world know we were the good guys talk about a catch

like it by watching it twice but i just couldn t i can safely say that i have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever ever again and i m not one to trash a movie but i truly believe this was awful it wasn t even funny in the slightest the only bits i enjoyed were the few scenes with christopher walken in them i think this film ruined both jack black and ben stiller for me all i can think of when i see one of their films now a days is this terrible movie and it reminds me not to waste my money amy poehler is so very annoying too overall well i think you get my point the stars are

presented in such a stylish and sophisticated fashion in the hands of any other movie crew this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale but with director curtis harrington whoever slew auntie roo and scriptwriter henry farrell hush hush sweet charlotte in charge it became a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of themes and genres the basic plot of the film is definitely horrific but there s a lot more to experience like love stories a swinging 1930 s atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tap dancing the setting is unquestionably what makes this movie so unique we re literally catapulted back to the 1930 s with a sublime depiction of that era s music religion theatrical business and wardrobes following the long and exhausting trial that sentenced their sons to life imprisonment for murder adelle debbie reynolds and helen shelley winters flee to california and attempt to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girls particularly adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment as she falls in love with a local millionaire but poor old helen continues to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia she only listens to the ramblings of a radio evangelist fears that she will be punished for the crimes her son committed and slowly develops violent tendencies the script although not entirely without flaws is well written and the film is adequately paced there s never a dull moment in what s the matter with helen although the singing tap dancing and tango sequences are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot but the atmosphere is continuously ominous and the film definitely benefices from the terrific acting performance of shelley winters she s downright scary as the unpredictable and introvert lady who s about to snap any second and especially during the last ten minutes or so she looks more petrifying than all the freddy kruegers jason voorhees and michael myers combined there are several terrific supportive characters who are sadly a little underdeveloped and robbed from their potential like mich al macliamm ir as the cocky elocution teacher agnes moorehead as the creepy priestess and timothy carey as the obtrusive visitor to the ladies house there are a couple of surprisingly gruesome scenes and moments of genuine shock to enjoy for the grand guignol fanatics among us but particularly the set pieces and costume designs even nominated for an oscar are breathtaking',\n","       'ah another movie with motorcycles hell s angels posse and steve a lame

love in the time of money is a visually stunning film to watch mr mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter this being a variation on the arthur schnitzler s play about the same theme the director transfers the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect each one is connected in one way or another to the next person but no one seems to know the previous point of contact stylishly the film has a sophisticated luxurious look we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat the only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits a big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter the acting is good under mr mattei s direction steve buscemi rosario dawson carol kane michael imperioli adrian grenier and the rest of the talented cast make these characters come alive we wish mr mattei good luck

be sold but at night must protect the orange when he comes enters a devilish nightclub featuring many bizarre and scary characters with the help of a stuffed cat the dog gets the orange back to the little girl and she is saved from a terrible scurvy death the mascot features new techniques i have not yet seen in starewicz s films the addition of sync sound and a mixture of live action with the stop motion animation makes for a new twist on starewicz s old style of puppetry live scenes of moving cars and people s feet walking by as a puppet sits on the concrete sidewalk is impressive and fresh the honking of cars and cries of street vendors is noteworthy due to the fact that small studio shifts to sound were costly and starewicz s utilization of the new technology seems like old hat new puppet characters in this film are frightening contributions to the devil s club scene twigss and newspaper shreds come to life skeletons of dead birds lay eggs which hatch skeleton chicks characters come flying in from all over on pats and pans and rocking horses a new editing technique uses quick zooms which are accomplished through editing to speed up the pace of what before might have been a slow scene overall starewicz is able to update his style of film making to meet the demands of a new audience making this film one of the best examples of his work',\n","       'what can i say not as bad as many here have made it out to be the only reason i even watched this film that i had previously never heard of before was strictly for ian mcshane i was not disappointed in the least ian mcshane was absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to his role he s always great to watch and for my money an extremely underused actor as for the rest of the film every other actor in the movie delivered strong solid performances these people certainly weren t being paid huge amounts of cash for their participation as this was a fairly low budget film but this did not mean that any of them mailed their appearances in everyone was convincing and compelling with the parts given to them i was even pleasantly surprised at adrian paul s performance though i must admit i have only

no car chases no explosions no bar room brawls sounds pretty dull huh but the reality is that i was completely absorbed by the film and it s just a well written little piece with an interesting hook

watch jackie chan for the fight scenes for the action its not so much concentrated on a good story or anything like that if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other american films from that era and even later you will realize that jackie chan s movies had over the top fights scenes and not really good plots while american movies had good plots but shitty action scenes compared to what jackie chan was doing at the time porn is watched for the porn jackie chan is watched for the action i think you people are rating it bad because there s no plot because you think thats how a smart movie critic would rate a good movie but the way i see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained sure the middle of the movie was boring very boring but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that this did change the way how american action movies were created they have even stollen scenes from this movie if you want a true man a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of jackie chan s hes pure in everyway he literally makes american movies look like a walk in the park and even in todays movies american

dimensional once this happens the story really falls flat and becomes tedious and just in case anyone didn t see the predictable lesbian undertones from miles way this is hammered home in the most banal terms at the end of the film the end scene is disappointing and phoned in and anyone who sat back and went ohhh so they were carpet munchers all along must have been out for the evening two

life this film is less a cultural story about a boy s life in a kibbutz but the deliberate demonization of kibbutz life in general in the first two minutes of the movie the milk man in charge of the cows rapes one of his calves and it s all downhill from there in terms of the characters representing typical kibbutznikim besides the two main characters a clinically depressed woman and her young son every one else in the kibbutz is a gross caricature of well evil the story centers on how the kibbutz like some sort of cult slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows there is no happiness no joy no laughter in this kibbutz every character situation represents a different horrific human vice like misogyny hypocrisy violence cultism repression etc for example while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome european looking 12 year old boy his older brother is a typical kibbutz youth complete with his jewish physical appearance and brutish personality he cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother he treats these volunteers like trash after his little brother pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he hasn t seen in a long time due to his military service he orders quote linda go take shower and i cum in two minutes there is one other good character in this movie a european foreigner who plays the mother s boyfriend when the animal rapist tries to hit the mother s son the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapist s arm he is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for violent behavior against one of the kibbutz members more hypocrisy the indescribably annoying french woman who plays the school teacher preaches that sex cannot happen before age 18 or without love and gives an account of the actual act that s supposed to be humorous for the audience but is really just stupid she of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the fields who then in turn screws the little boy s mom when her mental health takes a turn for the worse the film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult children get yanked out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders the mother apparently can t escape the kibbutz although in reality anyone was is always free to come and go as they choose it s a mystery how the boy s father died but you can rest assured the kibbutz drove him to it and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless wretched characters that weigh down on the mother and her son that s the gist of this movie one dimensional characters over dramatization dry performances and an insidious message that keeps trying to hammer itself into the audience s head that kibbutz life was degrading miserable and even deadly for those who didn t fit in i feel sorry for the guy who made this film obviously he had a bad experience growing up in a kibbutz but i feel

effort especially when it will be taken by its targets to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique rather than simply the poor writing direction and production of this particular film there is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war but poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening reminds me a bit of three kings which similarly

were sunk the shaky camera shots and angles general poor cinematography direction and wooden performances had already left us feeling flat and dissatisfied despondent we viewed on anne played by sally hawkins looked oddly and with no particular purpose directly at the camera on several occasions breaking our hard won fantasy of the moment and engaging us directly in an almost i ll find you stalking fashion poor rupert penry jones who played captain wentworth did his best with the script and direction bless him i hope they paid him well however as he was practically drowned on one occasion by a huge wave which predictably breached the seawall drenching him and his co actor they were nearly swept out to sea health and safety would have had a field day poor rupert was left spitting out sea water in order to deliver his line presumably there was not enough money left in the kitty for a re shoot of this scene anyone with any sense would have not attempted it on such a day in the first place other than mr penry jones alice krige gave the only convincing performance as lady russell but her efforts were soon counterbalanced by those of anthony head s unconvincing portrayal of annoying sir walter elliott towards the long awaited end of the film captain wentworth appeared to oddly grace anne with a visit every two seconds having taken great pains to avoid her for the majority of the movie it was as if he had developed a memory impediment which caused him to forget his very reason for being in contrast anne ran hyper ventilating from pillar to post in search of the good captain who in the meantime had managed to call upon almost the entirety of bath we are told in the course of only three or four minutes without even having worked up a sweat we experienced none of anne s charms crossing the screen indeed we were left wondering what charismatic captain wentworth had ever seen in plain spineless opinion less anne and why someone anyone did not tell mean winging sir walter to just shut the heck up the crucial kiss normally our favourite girlie moment was painfully drawn out as they moved in closer anne kept opening and closing her mouth which had the effect on screen of making her look as if she were chewing gum before lips finally met eww the most enjoyable thing about last night was the chocolates and the half hour exchange of views between mother and

basic instinct is a stylish and shocking neo noir thriller verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films both in his native holland and in america and this film is one of the reasons why the fourth man follows the strange story of gerard reve played by jeroen krabb a gay alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes while there he meets the seductive christine halsslag ren e soutendijk who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him even if it kills him paul verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it many of the occurrences in the fourth man could be what they appear to be but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on paul verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself and that is one of things i like best about him this film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards and that doesn t happen very often i wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to workbut you ll see what i mean when you see the film make sure you get the uncut version there is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one i ve mentioned but are lovely nonetheless a man gets eaten by lions another one has a pipe sent through his skull a boat is smashed in halflovely the acting in the fourth man isn t anything to write home about but it s solid throughout jeroen krabb holds the audience s attention and looks the part as the drunken writer it is ren e soutendijk that impresses the most though as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale her performance is what sharon stone would imitate nine years later with basic instinct but the original fatale did it best paul verhoeven s direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view all of which help to create the mystery of the story verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish but he obviously has talent and it s a shame that he doesn t put it to better use of all the verhoeven films i ve seen this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across trust me it s worth the effort',\n","       'yes i call this a perfect movie not one boring second a fantastic cast of mostly little known actresses and actors a great array of characters who are all well defined and who all have understandable motives i could sympathize with perfect lighting crisp black and white photography a fitting soundtrack an intelligent and harmonious set design and a story that is engaging and works it s one of those prime quality pictures on which all the pride of hollywood should rest the mark everyone should endeavor to reach barbara stanwyck is simply stunning there was nothing this actress couldn t do and she always went easy on the melodramatic side no hysterical outbursts with this lady i always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like bette davis or joan crawford and this movie confirmed my opinion always as tough as nails and at the same time conveying true sentiments it is fair to add that she also got many good parts during her long career and this one is by far the least interesting the title fits this movie very well it is about desires human desires i think everyone can understand actually no one seems to be scheming in this movie all characters act on impulse everybody wants to be happy without hurting anybody else the sad fact that this more often than not leads to complications makes for the dramatic content into which i will not go here i liked what this movie has to say about youth about maturing and about the necessity to compromise the movie i associate most with this one is alfred hitchcock s shadow of a doubt it creates a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured small town america the story has a certain similarity with fritz lang s considerably harsher movie clash by night made one year earlier where stanywck stars in a similar part i can also recommend it',\n","       'i can t believe it that was the worst movie i

this movie made me remember why was the original show great not really but robin certainly was which brings me to this movie i was pleasantly surprised expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show which in a way it was but of course the real focus was on robin it was interesting to see robin s journey from struggling street jester to national tv star and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long suffering wife and my hat is off to star chris diamantopoulos as he portrayed mr williams with integrity sensitivity and heart not just a cute impression although it was even dead on on an unrelated note i noticed that robin s struggles were in some ways similar to andy kaufman who was under appreciated by network tv and held back creatively but that s the taxi behind the scenes biopic all in all this was a very enjoyable flick in which i felt i got to know a little more of the man behind the orkan the acting was solid by all never melodramatic like i suspected and the story moved along well performances that were particularly good were by those who played garry marshall and john belushi the scene in which belushi heckles robin was a hoot not a great masterpiece by any means i would have liked to have seen a tad more about pam dawber but definitely watchable especially for those robin williams and mork mindy fans out there

obvious throughout this film i am surprised that none of the reviews i have read mention what i found most unlikeable about this film and what kept it from reaching even a portion of its potential it looked and felt like it was made for television to give some credit to ms english many of the jokes that simply did not work on a movie screen would have been terrific on tv and maybe a laugh track would have helped so much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on tv but looked awkward or odd on a big screen if the whole film had been chopped up into a mini series or a sit com i think it could have worked but this is cinema and sadly ms english s talents didn t translate i cringed at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors the writers that i felt like i came out of the theater half shriveled meg ryan is her usual perky cute self except for the awful plastic surgery she has had on her face but where did she have a chance to use her talent she has made films where she doesn t recreate her stereo typed role and done them well but not here annette bening seemed to simply go through the motions such a great talent and yet such a poor performance i enjoyed the other women characters but they were more caricature than substance and it was sad to see what worked in this film in the 1930s doesn t translate to the 2000s and no one helped ms english get the changes updates or subtleties right if only she as writer director and producer had reached out for some assistance i think it could have been good but it was not it s so

it is actually believable that these type of people are out there there is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie yea sure you get laughed at when it is found out about but it still suggests that you wait steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet it is still funny',\n","       'i shall begin with a disclaimer this movie is not recommended for anyone who lack interest or have never played ff7 the game before watching the movie relies on the audience s knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot elements and it does so very subtly do your homework before watching this wonderful piece of cg film and i promise it ll be that much better with that in mind this film has some of the most spectacular cg sequences i have ever witnessed the whole experience felt like an extra long fmv sequence from the game on steroids yeah the attention to detail in each scene especially in the heavy action oriented ones is so impeccable it left me with a sense of awe i believe the soundtrack is simplified so as to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music again for those who are familiar with the ff7 story and background the music should not surprise anyone although the timing and placement of each soundtrack from the original accompany each scene and mood to the point where the music simply enhances the animation once again i myself having only played through ff7 once thoroughly enjoyed this piece of art from square enix and that is the feel in most scenes choreographed and organized like a dance in short if you enjoyed the music or the game final fantasy 7 this film will blow you out of the water if you re in the unfortunate majority who has not experienced the goodness known as ff7 on playstation or pc doing so before watching the movie will allow for an exponentially greater experience finally i just want to make a note of the quality in animating this film characters move with fluidity each scene background comes to life and tells its own story for those who criticize the thinness and dependency of the story plot i urge you to reexamine the animation facial reactions subtle clues that bring about another level of entertainment above the typical narration method of story plot delivery square enix and the great tetsuya nomura has set a new bar for quality animation and storytelling advent children has ushered in a new era for cg animations allowing the subtleties that lie in each character to speak volumes in and of themselves thanks square enix the wait was well worth it',\n","       'encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film bad mistake i ve seen 950 films and this is truly one of the worst of them it s awful in almost every way editing pacing storyline acting soundtrack the film s only song a lame country tune is played no less than four times the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film the only thing that prevents me giving this a 1 score is harvey keitel while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort one for keitel obsessives only',\n","       'victor mclaglen s performance is one of the finest in film history

studio rko radio pictures joseph h august s cinematography is at its very best here however august s stunning portion was mostly overlooked he didn t receive the oscar nomination he rightly deserved this is a psychological drama with thought philosophy sadness all conveyed with as little words as possible',\n","       'this movie starred a totally forgotten star from the 1930s jack pearl radio s baron munchausen as well as jimmy durante however 7 1 2 decades later it s being billed as a three stooges film because they are the only ones in the film who the average person would recognize today film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful edna may oliver as well as zazu pitts as for the stooges this is a film from there very early days before mgm had any idea what to do with the team at this point they were known as ted healy and his stooges as healy was the front man fortunately for the stooges they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man read up on him you ll see what i mean and the rest is history within a year they were making very successful shorts for columbia and executives at mgm were soon kicking themselves for losing the team this sort of thing was a common occurrence at mgm a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy such as the films of buster keaton laurel and hardy abbott and costello and others in fact up until they left for columbia mgm put them in a wide variety of odd film roles including acting with clark gable and joan crawford in dancing lady and oddly in this film they didn t act as a team they just did various supporting roles such as larry playing the piano this particular film begins with pearl and durante lost in the african jungle when they are rescued and brought home all sense of structure to the film falls apart and the film becomes almost like a variety show punctuated by scenes with the leads here and there as for pearl i could really see why he never made a successful transition to films as he has the personality of a slug but slightly less welcome as for durante i never knew what the public saw in him as least as far as his films are concerned he was loud andloud he apparently took time off from helping mgm to ruin buster keaton s career to make this film together pearl and durante rely on lots of verbal humor and vaudeville style routines that tend to fall rather flat in this film the stooges they didn t yet have the right chemistry seeing healy doing the job that moe did in their later films is odd what they did in the film was pretty good but because all the segments were short they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routines stooges fans might be very frustrated at this though die hard fans may want to see this so that they can complete their life long goal of seeing everything stooge even the rotten joe derita and joe besser films oh and did they got bad after the deaths of shemp and curly overall the film is rather dull and disappointing however there are a couple interesting things to look for in the mess at about the 13 minute mark you will see a brief scene where a tour guide on a bus is singing look carefully as this is walter brennan in a role you d certainly never expect another unusual thing to look for in the film is the clean as a whistle song starting at about 22 minutes into the film this song and dance number is clearly an example of a so called pre code scene that never would have been allowed in films after 1934 when the production code was strengthened despite the word clean in the title it s a very titillating number with naked women showing lots of flesh enough to stimulate but not enough to really show anything it s quite shocking when seen today though such excesses were pretty common in the early 1930s finally at the 63 minute mark see jimmy durante set race relations back a few decades see the film you ll see that i mean',\n","       'an unmarried woman named stella bette

and i cry easily but they were well made if dated trying to remake this in 1990 was just a stupid idea i guess midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of beaches to get this made this predictably bombed the story is laughable and dated by today s standards even though midler and alvarado give good performances this film really drags and i was bored silly by the end stephen

real character instead more like a film stereotype that just needed to be in the movie or else another title was needed some of the best acting came from a role that wasn t really important to the story that of marcial the sub intelligent yet humble drunkard of course the scenery the cultural tidbits of the canary islands and other wow moments were interesting but the movie fell short of a documentary in case this was its real intention and most importantly as a solid drama',\n","       'this a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous one of the actors is george clooney and i m not a fan but this roll is not bad another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack the man of constant sorrow i recommand this movie to everybody greetings bart',\n","       'from the film s first shot keira knightley as elizabeth bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn thus invoking all the clich s cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strong minded rebellious female character in period drama i knew i was in for something to make me want to kill myself joe wright seemed not only to have not read the book but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact jane austen s subtle nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling delicate social interaction in eighteenth century english drawing rooms but a sort of u certificate wuthering heights thus we were treated to every scene between elizabeth and darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain not to mention that jane austen and in particular p p is not about passion sexual tension or love it s about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society which was completely ignored so that the bennets house was a rambunctious chaotic place where everybody shouts at once runs around leaves their underwear on chairs and pigs wander happily through the house the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from a matrix reloaded style dance orgy and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for propriety the genius of jane austen lies in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap so both the brilliance of jane austen and the very factor that allows her plots particularly in this film to function was completely erased subtlety in general was nowhere int his film sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performances it was so obviously trying to be a serious film the humour which is pride prejudice both austen s methodology and her appeal was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this po faced melodrama and when it was allowed in was handled so clumsily pride prejudice is a serious narrative which makes serious points yes but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour they are embedded in it you can t lose jane austen s technique leaving only the bare bones of the story and expect the themes to remain not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavy handed mystical numinous fauxbrow cinematography elizabeth bennett is supposed to be a woman an adult mature and sensible and clear sighted keira knightley played the first half of the film like an empty headed giggling schoolgirl and the second half like an empty headed schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine elizabeth s wit her combative verbal exchanges her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybody s follies including her own her strength and composure and her fantastic clear sightedness were completely lost and replaced with what a lot of giggling and staring into the distance rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation and not genuinely raging either no these were petulant hissy fits and where the great strength of austen s elizabeth at least in austen s eyes was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety knightley s elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention furthermore she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strong minded and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it an astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance in which quest for blandness and weakness she was ably matched by matthew macfayden donald sutherland as mr bennet seemed weak ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes mr bennet so fascinating and tragic his special bond with lizzie as the only two sensible people in a world of fools was completely lost not least because both of them were fools in a world of fools and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact mr bingley was no longer amiable and well meaning to the point of folly but was played as a complete retard for cheap laughs and the woman who was playing jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all the script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of jane austen delivered with remarkable clumsiness and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy just get the bbc adaptation on dvd and save yourself the heartache',\n","       'it had all the clich s of movies of this type and no substance the plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie i felt like a sucker for watching it the production was good however the script and acting were b movie quality the casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors the good actors didn t hold their own nor did they lift up the others this movie is not worthy of more words but i will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten

surrealist art but this film by bunuel with some ideas from dali left me cold bunuel had a life long grudge against the catholic church and delighted in trying to offend catholics in fairly silly ways this is one of the silliest almost like what you d expect from a smart aleck 18 year old in film class the last few minutes of the movie which have nothing to do with anything else are a final nose thumbing at religion if you read the scholars regarding this slow paced occasionally amusing film it s all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression if that is indeed the point then bunuel expresses it in the most roundabout fashion possible the central male character is a nasty brute who loves kicking dogs and knocking blind men down in the street and who mentally turns billboard ads into strange sexual fantasies is this behavior the church s fault for interrupting his lovemaking or is he just a jerk i vote for the latter i think bunuel must have had a lot of personal hangups and chose the catholics as the ones to blame there are a few moments where you might cry aha surrealism a cow in a bed a giraffe falling out a window a poor model a man shredding a feather pillow a woman flushing a toilet while we watch pictures of seething lava or a mud pithard to tell in b w the rest is forgettable self indulgence unfortunately bunuel was still chasing the same bogey men through the rest of his career viridiana discreet charm if you re interested in seeing surrealism on the screen check out jean cocteau s early work',\n","       'i had a hard time

about this sort of thing happening in modern civilization there is an excellent book called outlaw seas or the outlaw sea and it describes in story after story how these things do happen the lawlessness of the high seas is a reality for a number of reasons one many of the world s freighters are of questionable registry nationality and it s difficult to impossible to enforce international laws when the ships owners don t have an office in a real country two many ship lines employ crews from dirt poor third world countries the crews are often like illegal immigrant workers threatened and bullied into complying with questionable or illegal practices three there is often a language barrier not only between the officers and the crew but also between the crew members themselves the crew are rewarded for their compliance and their silence four once committing an illegal act the ships are able to hide in plain sight with little more than a fresh coat of paint anyway it s fascinating reading horrifying story excellent movie does anyone else notice how hbo seems to make the best and most important movies hollywood has trouble releasing enough oscar worthy movies in any

investigation of the wine business into wider concerns about globalisation homogenisation the effect of the mass media the power of capital and the need for diversity the film is shot on hand held dv which some might find offputting but which does enable nossiter to catch people off guard on a number of occasions which probably would not have been possible using more conventional equipment despite the sprawling feel of the film the editing is very sharp not only giving us a parade of the world s dogs but also undercutting a number of interviewees comments with somewhat contradictory visual images and giving others sufficient rope to hang themselves to a degree this evoked michael moore s recent work although nossiter operates in a more subtle way but probably the roots of the film go back to marcel ophuls the sorrow and the pity both in the way the film is constructed and in the emergence of salt of the earth french peasants as the stars de montille pere et fils were present at

cheerleaders who get stranded in an abandoned cabin on the way to a football game only to be offed one by one again this film could have been ok if the gore quotient was upped a bit why directors especially those doing direct to video flicks are afraid to show any gore is beyond me now i am not a huge fan of excessive gore but come onwhy else would anyone rent a movie called cheerleader massacre besides that problem the film suffers from a shot on a home video camera cheapness it looks cheap sounds cheap and the actors aren t all that good it tries to throw us off track to who the
